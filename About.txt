Limitations
- Single thread slow
- not crawling all file types
- not a complete search ingine
- Storage is not optimal
- Cosine similarity not the way. I need to use reverse indexing


Good
- keyword searching after crawling on the cached data so faster
- Extract keyword for all docs together making it faster
- good keywords extracted when compared to existing ones
- Search results are quite accurate
