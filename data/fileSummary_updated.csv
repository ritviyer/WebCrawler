cup on february tottenham are in action on the same day against brighton and hove albion on home soil chelsea end a run of four matches without a win in the premier league after defeating tottenham at stamford bridge the home side took the lead in the early stages of the second half through a stunner from hakim ziyech before thiago silva added a second with a glancing header from mason mount s free kick spurs will feel aggrieved after harry kane saw a first half strike controversially ruled out for a foul on thiago silva however antonio conte s men were lacklustre in the second period and as a result his unbeaten run in the league is halted by his former team full time chelsea tottenham rudiger tries to run out the clock in the right corner but fouls davies in the process rudiger stands firm at the back to make a crucial interception to prevent hojbjerg from releasing moura in the final third sa l h ziyech ziyech made the decisive breakthrough for the blues with a fine strike the

replaces winks for the closing stages of the contest marcos alonso c hudson odoi alonso replaces hudson odoi at the back to shore up the chelsea defence save kane rises to attack a corner from winks on the right flank and he directs his effort towards the right corner kepa makes a reaction stop but appears to hurt himself in the process bergwijn runs at the chelsea defence and tries to slide a throughball towards the run of kane forcing rudiger to clear behind chance kane feeds a throughball into the path of bergwijn on the edge of the chelsea box but the forward scuffs his first time effort and it trickles through to kepa there s no way through for spurs in the final third chelsea have been excellent at the back in the second half quelling the threat of kane thiago silva y d is the oldest player to score in the premier league since february when year old ryan giggs netted against queens park rangers for manchester united mount bursts into the right inside channel and tries to fire at goal from a tight angle but lloris gets out to make a block with his body chelsea are attempting to control the game to work their way towards the three points game management is required from the blues especially after spurs antics during the week n kant jorginho jorginho is withdrawn after a quiet performance kante replaces the italy international in the middle of the park hojbjerg almost threads the needle to release doherty in the right inside channel but the throughball just evades the wing back on the charge sarr makes a vital block at the back to stop a strike from doherty after he was teed up by skipp in the right inside channel save lukaku rolls past a challenge from sanchez on the edge of the tottenham box and rifles a strike at goal from the left inside channel but lloris beats his effort away lloris commits himself at the back to attempt to clear a cross field pass from azpilicueta away from hudson odoi and he just does enough although doherty is required to mop up the danger ziyech attempts a speculative on his right foot rather than his left but he floats a tame strike into the hands of lloris ziyech whips a dangerous cross into the box from the right flank that lukaku tries to attack but kane is there to divert it over his own bar ziyech runs at davies down the right flank and wins a free kick as he draws a foul chelsea have another chance to send a dangerous ball into the box mount has registered his th assist for chelsea since the start of the campaign the most of any player at the club in this period across all competitions chance kane bursts down the left flank and digs out a cross it is deflected back to skipp who nods an offload to bergwijn who tries to shoot on the turn but his effort is saved comfortably by kepa o skipp j tanganga tanganga is replaced after a difficult game and is replaced by skipp spurs move to three at the back lucas moura r sessegnon moura replaces sessegnon for the visitors in the final third sessegnon could have had an assist on another day m mount assist mount swings a cross into the box from the left flank that thiago silva rises and guides into the back of the net with a precise header thiago silva goal goallllllllllllllllllllll thiago silva makes it two chelsea the brazil international latches onto a sublime cross from mount and glances his header away from lloris into the bottom right corner dier brings down hudson odoi on the left flank which bemuses the tottenham players mount swings a perfect cross into the box for thiago silva to attack and he gets between two white shirts to direct his effort into the back of the net over mount and hudson odoi combine in the final third which sees the former launch a powerful left footed strike that creeps just over the bar chelsea have the lead and are looking comfortable on the ball spurs have to hold out amid the pressure at the start of the second half lloris denies ziyech the winger almost has a second but sees his effort saved by a fine stop from lloris ziyech plays azpillicueta down the right flank and he cuts a ball back to mount he shoots on the turn only to be denied by sanchez s block ziyech gathers the rebound and hammers a strike towards goal on the half volley that lloris has to palm away c hudson odoi assist hudson odoi bursts away from tanganga before offloading to ziyech the winger does the rest with a sublime effort h ziyech goal goallllllllllllllllllllllllll ziyech scores a stunner chelsea the winger collects on the edge of the spurs box and curls a precise effort away lloris into the top left corner hudson odoi starts the move with burst past tanganga down the left flank and he surges away from the defender hudson odoi offloads to ziyech who takes a touch before curling a sublime effort into the back of the net a super strike we re back under way at stamford bridge after a brief delay so one of the goal nets could be repaired chelsea are enduring the same struggles as their last four premier league matches in front of goal lukaku looks devoid of confidence in the final third missing two decent openings the blues need the belgian or someone else to step up to capitalise on the chances that are being created it s goalless at the break in the premier league clash between chelsea and tottenham at stamford bridge chelsea had a host of chances in the early stages but were unable to get the breakthrough as romelu lukaku and callum hudson odoi failed to hit the target spurs will feel that they should be ahead after harry kane converted from close range only for his effort to be controversially disallowed for a foul on thiago silva half time chelsea tottenham sessegnon hands chelsea a free kick in a useful position on the right flank after bringing down azpilicueta ziyech takes the free kick but floats his delivery straight into the hands of lloris there will be three minutes of added time over chelsea win two corners in succession and mount sends the second in from the right flank thiago silva rises highest but he sends his effort just over the bar block lukaku latches on to a throughball in space down the left flank he breaks into the box and lines up a drive that dier diverts behind chelsea are incredulous as tanganga survives pulling the shirt of hudson odoi before hojbjerg gets the decision from the referee after being fouled by kovacic jorginho yellow card jorginho fouled bergwijn in the build up to kane s disallowed goal and is booked after the fact disallowed goal kane slots the ball home with composure after latching on to a cutback from sessegnon however his celebrations are short lived as the referee blows for a nudge on thiago silva in the box the contact from kane was minimal but the referee and var agree that it was enough to knock the defender off balance wide rudiger wins the ball at the back and continues his run up the field he combines with ziyech and bursts down the right flank rudiger sends a cross into the box that lukaku steers behind under pressure from sanchez chance hojbjerg releases sessegnon down the left flank and he surges into the box only to drag the ball harmlessly wide of the post j tanganga yellow card tanganga brings down hudson odoi on the charge and goes into the book wide lukaku works the ball to hudson odoi in the final third who cuts inside to fire at goal on his right foot it bends away from goal after lukaku in the middle opts to leave it on its trajectory miss chelsea play around the tottenham press and mount coasts into space down the right flank he exchanges passes with ziyech before sending a cutback towards lukaku but the forward misses his kick at goal thiago silva has to be careful as he catches bergwijn from behind in the middle of the park the contact was slight but the brazilian will be treading lightly now kane tries to slide a throughball forward for the run of bergwijn but it evades the dutchman and travels through to kepa mount makes another probing run down the right flank that hojbjerg eventually halts with a fine sliding tackle the england man has had space on the flank thiago silva yellow card thiago silva blocks off the run of bergwijn racing upfield and goes into the book spurs clear their lines from two crosses into the box from ziyech before mount sends tanganga crashing into the advertising hoardings with a nudge fortunately the defender is okay mount surges into the right inside channel and clips a cross to the back post that tanganga has to head behind at the back post sarr goes down after being late on the ankle by doherty which is not punished on the field var has a look at the incident but deems that the referee made the correct call bergwijn breaks on the counter for the visitors and coasts past two chelsea players before being halted by a good sliding challenge from kovacic stop winks charges through the middle of the chelsea midfield and reaches the edge of the box before firing at goal he gets plenty of pace behind his strike but kepa gets down to make a solid stop save ziyech twists and turns on the edge of the tottenham box and he sends a curling strike towards goal it seems a tame effort but lloris opts to punch it away rather than claim the ball dier makes a positive charge forward to the edge of the chelsea box the blues get men back to surround the spurs defender before he fouls thiago silva attempting to regain possession over mount swings the resulting corner into the tottenham box for thiago silva to attack but he plants his header over the bar ziyech collects in space on the edge of the spurs box and tries to release mount down the right flank but sessegnon gets back to sweep the ball behind chelsea probe in the final third and jorginho offloads to ziyech in space he lines up a drive on his left foot that is diverted behind for a corner by davies wide ziyech angles a cross to the back post for the run of hudson odoi in the left inside channel but the winger heads his effort narrowly wide of the left post chance lukaku latches on to a precise cutback from mount from the right flank and has space to fire at goal in the box however the forward scuffs his right footed effort over the bar a huge chance spurned we re under way at stamford bridge tottenham have won just one of their last away league games against chelsea d l winning in april with current boss antonio conte in charge of the blues that day spurs have made four changes to their side that beat leicester late on in their last outing bergwijn gets the nod in the final third after his late

skipp reguilon and emerson all drop to the bench chelsea have made two changes to their side that drew against brighton last time out sarr comes into the fold to replace alonso in the chelsea backline

ziyech romelu lukaku tottenham were well beaten by chelsea in the efl cup over two legs the one bright spot of for the blues however antonio conte is unbeaten in the premier league since taking his place in the spurs dugout tottenham highlighted their improvement under conte with an incredible late comeback against leicester scoring twice after the th minute to snatch all three points at the king power stadium conte will be determined to keep up his run against his former club and maintain spurs surge for a top four place chelsea have endured a frustrating time of late in the premier league enduring a four game winless run that has knocked them off the pace in the race for the crown thomas tuchel s men were held last time out by brighton and hove albion as adam webster cancelled out hakim ziyech s strike the blues might be looking over their shoulder after their slump with tottenham among a number of teams that are closing in behind chelsea cannot afford another underwhelming

when chelsea agreed to pay million m to sign hakim ziyech from ajax in the winter of they thought they knew what they were getting a wizard with the ball and with a wand of a left foot the morocco international was signed to add an x factor to an attacking unit that was young and energetic but lacked a bit of guile editors picks from title glory to a m divorce inside conte s tumultuous chelsea tenure romain emperor psg transfer target faivre ready for the big time is rafael leao really the new henry ibrahimovic s little brother finally realising potential at ac milan it s not over yet southampton give hope to liverpool and chelsea by showing that man city are not invincible ziyech s first months at stamford bridge then have been something of a disappointment he came into sunday s clash against tottenham with just four league goals and five league assists to his name in a chelsea shirt and with question marks over his attitude after his moody reaction to scoring from long range against brighton in midweek but on a day when thomas tuchel was crying out for an x factor in front of goal after a frustrating first half ziyech produced a moment of quality that harked back to his ajax days and could be the catalyst for him to finally start producing on a weekly basis for the blues spurs came into the game having not lost a league match since antonio conte took charge in november while chelsea had not won in four and had taken just eight points from the previous available during a spell that has seen them fall out of the title race and tumble towards those challenging for fourth spot after a goalless first half that chelsea largely dominated but could have fallen behind in had harry kane not been penalised for a push on thiago silva before firing into the bottom corner ziyech wasted little time in working his magic as he cut inside around yards from goal before bending a supreme effort past a frozen hugo lloris and into the top corner hakim ziyech take a bow

i hit it a lttle bit hard but in the end i saw it go in remarkably it was ziyech s first league goal at stamford bridge and what a way to do it ajax fans grew used to him producing such moments and chelsea fans will hope to too after his slow start to life at the club it seems though that ajax may have provided ziyech with the inspiration he needed to score such a goal with their own efforts on sunday a couple of hours before kick off in london ajax were celebrating their own victory as noussair mazraoui s own curling effort bounced in off the post to secure a win over psv in what many believe could prove to be a title decider in the eredivisie mazraoui revealed post match that ziyech had been watching and had sent a message on whatsapp to his former team mate joking that the full back s winner was a horrible goal whether seeing his former side produce such a moment reminded ziyech of his own ability or not his overall performance was that of a player who is rediscovering his confidence tuchel set up his side in a formation that had ziyech mount and callum hudson odoi switching positions throughout the minutes with the trio laying on a number of chances that on another day would have been finished by romelu lukaku hudson odoi claimed the assist or at least the final pass for ziyech s goal before winning the free kick that mount delivered onto the head of thiago silva for chelsea s second of the afternoon ziyech eventually left the field to a standing ovation as he was substituted in the final minutes having suffered from a bought of cramp that was no doubt brought on by a display that was not just thrilling in attack but also saw him work hard to press and win the ball back to help chelsea keep their first premier league clean sheet in seven matches it was one of his best matches today because he was very reliable tuchel said of a player who had he not fallen out with morocco manager vahid halilhodzic would have been at the africa cup of nations right now it was also maybe he best position to be on the wing we had the wide position on the right wing that position does not normally exist in that particular manner when we play it is more of a wing back maybe we can think about doing this more it was good because it gave him the opportunity to take risks where it was possible to take risks he was very reliable on the ball in moments where it is necessary the work rate was always outstanding you can always rely on him for work rate and counter pressing so yes well done and he needs to keep on going like everyone else the importance of this win cannot be understated tuchel had described his team as being mentally and physically tired after the brighton draw with the blues having played more games since the november international break than any other premier league side a point the club have been keen to hammer home in recent days now the players will who are not away on international duty in the coming days will be given a week off to recharge their batteries before their fa cup fourth round tie against league one outfit plymouth argyle on february from there they will head to the united arab emirates for the club world cup with their meeting with crystal palace on february the only league match they will play between now and the first weekend of march by the time that palace game comes around some of those teams in the battle for fourth may have closed the gap on chelsea but beating spurs ensured that they will return to the competition still sat third in the table ziyech s wizardry was the catalyst for that and the hope now is that he can continue to cast his spells through the second half of the campaign so that chelsea s miserable winter can be put behind them contact us terms of service privacy policy

arnold as liverpool look to run down the clock here there will be six minutes of added time to be played here j milner roberto firmino milner is now on for firmino to see this game out fabinho penalty goal gooaalll fabinho steps up and slots the penalty away into the bottom corner sending guaita the wrong way he s met with a chorus of boos from the crowd penalty given jota seemed to initiate the contact with guaita after missing his shot but there is a lengthy var delay as it is checked the referee goes to the monitor to review the footage himself and gives a penalty jota goes down in the area alexander arnold finds his teammate with a sublime ball forward jota then takes too long with his shot with just the keeper ahead of him and then hits the deck after he scuffs his shot wide chance olise runs onto a long punt upfield from andersen and has only alisson to beat he tries to lob the keeper with the ball on the bounce and alisson just about gets back into his goal to claw the ball behind for a corner j schlupp yellow card jota skips clear of his man with some neat skill and schlupp goes into the book after tripping him up cynically roberto firmino yellow card firmino is booked for one foul too many guaita comes out of his goal to head away a ball forward to jota and liverpool have a throw in on the left side robertson heads a long ball back towards his keeper and nearly wrongfoots alisson he just about gathers to stop the ball trickling into the unguarded net c benteke j mateta mateta is also replaced by benteke j ayew w hughes ayew is coming on for hughes here as vieira makes an offensive change olise clambers all over jones trying to win a free kick for his side and lands awkwardly play is paused as he receives treatment on the field olise finds gallagher on the edge of the box in a promising position but he s penalised for handball as he takes the ball down the home fans are roaring on their side in encouragement can they grab an equaliser here schlupp finds eze down the left wing and then races onto his return pass he fires his shot into the side netting from close range when a pass was probably a better option alexander arnold appears to be limping a little as he gears up to take a free kick on halfway it looks like he ll continue for now though e eze o douard eze is on for goalscorer edouard here palace try to launch an attack but mitchell s pass through to schlupp is overhit and it goes behind for a goal kick the home fans are not happy about how long liverpool are taking with their throw ins here gallagher wins a foul on halfway after a late challenge and palace have a free kick palace are intent on playing the ball around at the back and guaita just about clears the ball away after some intense pressure from the liverpool frontline w hughes yellow card hughes flies in on jones with a rash tackle and goes into the referee s book t minamino a oxlade chamberlain liverpool are taking an age to make this change much to the fury of the palace fans eventually oxlade chamberlain makes way for minamino olise whips in the free kick from the left but he puts too much on it and it rolls out for a throw gallagher hits the deck after spinning past henderson and palace have a free kick from a wide position a goal is no less than palace deserve and their fans are in fine voice now andersen collects a loose clearance from defence and rasps a shot just wide from yards j mateta assist mateta showed great composure to pass it there and edouard couldn t miss o douard goal goaaalll palace have one back schlupp plays mateta through on goal and he races clear with edouard to his left he draws the keeper then slips the ball to his teammate and edouard slots home into an empty net game on good chance oxlade chamberlain has an age to pick out a cross from the right and he finds henderson with a ball to his feet the liverpool skipper swivels and shoots just wide of the post firmino shows good feet and then shifts the ball out wide to alexander arnold his ball through to oxlade chamberlain is overhit though and guaita collects c gallagher yellow card gallagher goes into the book for a cynical challenge on fabinho on halfway chance how have palace not scored olise crosses in from the right and schlupp heads the ball back across goal to edouard five yards out he backheels it straight into the arms of alisson though chance edouard races clear down the centre of the pitch on a counter attack he finds olise to his right who turns robertson inside out before firing a ball across goal gallagher can t connect cleanly with it though and it trickles wide the hosts get us underway with the second half alisson has so far perhaps been the difference between the two sides and has managed to repel the crystal palace attackers for now palace have looked dangerous on the counter attack though and if the hosts continue with their approach the goals should surely arrive it s been an entertaining half of football and palace will feel hard done by to be two behind robertson set up van dijk for a simple header before delivering a great ball for oxlade chamberlain to double their lead the hosts then missed a string of gilt edged opportunities with mateta a particularly bad offender and could easily have pulled level with some better finishing half time crystal palace liverpool there will be just one minute of additional time here jota barges into the back of ward as the defender looked to clear the ball and it s a free kick on halfway to the hosts another chance for palace olise picks up a loose ball in midfield and plays a great pass through to mateta who only has the keeper to beat he rounds alisson but the keeper gets down to save his shot and it goes behind for a corner chance matip gives the ball away cheaply in defence and olise hares in on goal with only one defender ahead of him he shimmies onto his right foot and fires a shot at goal which alisson saves with his feet he had to do better there liverpool are knocking the ball around very nicely in the palace half here alexander arnold delivers a good cross from the right which ward just about heads back safely into the arms of guaita gallagher clatters jota with a frustrated late tackle it s a free kick to the visitors but no booking for the palace man schlupp attempts to start an attack for palace on the break but fires a poor pass straight into the chest of van dijk a robertson assist it s another assist for robertson he s been causing all sorts of problems to the palace defence today a oxlade chamberlain goal gooall liverpool it had been coming a lovely passing move ends up with robertson in acres of space on the left he delivers a cross to the unmarked oxlade chamberlain who takes the ball down on his chest before rifling home from close range guaita is being furiously pressed by the liverpool forwards and has to put a clearance straight out of play after pressure from jones robertson picks up a long crossfield pass on the left flank and hammers a cross towards the goal it s overhit but firmino picks up the loose ball and wins another corner for his side the visitors are being afforded far too much space in attack here firmino picks the ball up in the area and plays the ball off his opposite man for a corner chance for liverpool firmino is in space on the byline and cuts it back to jota with his back to goal he lays it off for fabinho on the edge of the area but he blazes his effort over the bar chance what a save olise feeds ward down the right flank and he has an absolute age to feed mateta in the box with just the keeper to beat he hits his effort too close to the keeper though and alisson sticks out his right glove to parry it away henderson finds alexander arnold on the right with a great crossfield pass the right back tries an ambitious first time cross and it s thumped clear by the palace defence liverpool had seven shots so far today in contrast to palace s zero palace are allowed to settle on the ball for the first time in the game edouard chases onto a long ball forward on the left wing but his pass is cut out by the defence as he looked to find mateta olise surges forward in a rare attack for the hosts but his ball down the line to edouard is overhit and alisson comes out to collect it liverpool are utterly dominant here robertson and henderson both fire some wild attempts at goal which are both blocked robertson then curls his follow up into the back post and oxlade chamberlain is left completely free he slices his effort however and it hits the side netting jones whips in a tempting cross from the left flank and oxlade chamberlain is inches away from connecting with a shot guaita just about gathers the ball in his arms a robertson assist it was a great cross from robertson his seventh assist of the season v van dijk goal goooalll liverpool robertson swings in a corner from the left into the near post and van dijk runs onto it completely unmarked to thump a header into the top left corner half chance henderson tries his luck from yards as the ball is cleared to him and guaita has to get down low to his right to push the shot away alexander arnold crosses into the far post and jones collects possession on the left of the area before teeing up robertson just inside the box his shot is curled well over the bar though robertson delivers a free kick into the penalty area from deep and it s headed to matip on the right side of the box he can t get the ball out of his feet however and loses possession before he can get a shot away it s a scrappy start from both sides as neither team can get the ball under control mateta takes down a high ball nicely but his pass forward to edouard goes out of play for a throw in it s the visitors who kick us off here the players are coming out onto the pitch and we re about to get underway here conor gallagher has been directly involved in premier league goals

hand face liverpool at the weekend it s a point apiece for these two sides in the end then and despite leaving it so late brighton can consider themselves unfortunate not be taking all three here palace offered practically nothing going forward for the entirety of the match but took a shock lead with gallagher s well taken finish potter s side looked like they would rue gross missed penalty in the first half and leave with nothing before andersen deflected maupay s cross into his own net with only a few minutes remaining full time brighton crystal palace march runs into the area and lamptey is clattered over as he looks to pick up the loose ball the crowd and players scream for a penalty but the referee gives a free kick the other way and that might be it chance march races down the right flank and whips in a great cross onto the head of welbeck he just can t keep his header down though and it s a goal kick to palace mac allister whips in the corner and it s headed out to march he tries his luck with a wild effort from outside the box but it flies well wide of the goal lamptey races forward onto a long pass down the line and wins a corner for his side we re going to have four minutes of additional time here will there be a late goal brighton now pour forward in search of a late winner roared on by their fans welbeck nearly latches onto a long ball forward but it just evades him to go behind for a goal kick j andersen own goal goooalllll maupay skips clear of his man wide on the left of the penalty area and drills a low cross that deflects off andersen inside the six yard box and past butland into the goal palace have every man behind the ball trying to see out waves of pressure from the hosts the away side seem fairly comfortable heading away crosses into the area cucurella is scythed down by gallagher as he tries to emerge with possession on halfway no booking is given and brighton rapidly restart play burn throws an arm across the chest of gallagher and the palace man makes the most of it to slow down play it s a free kick to the away side and nothing more c benteke m olise benteke is on the field in olise s place palace are camped on the edge of their own area after some concerted pressure cucurella wins a corner for his side after his header is deflected behind it s all brighton now mac allister finds welbeck with a nice pass into his feet but he just loses control of possession and palace get it away lamptey delivers a great cross in from the right after the ball is nicely worked out wide welbeck has his header just about taken off him by andersen though and palace can clear the corner comes in and webster has a free header but he can t connect and his effort is scuffed wide palace are ready for a siege of their goal here lamptey bursts forward on the overlap and his cross is deflected behind for a corner d welbeck j veltman welbeck is also on for veltman as potter has to go for it now s march p gro march is making his way on for gross a goal out of nowhere for palace then can potter s side respond c gallagher goal goooaaall palace it s completely against the run of play ward surges forward on a rare foray into the brighton half and crosses it into schlupp at the near post he turns and lays it off to gallagher who slams the bouncing ball into the net from close range j schlupp assist schlupp showed fantastic composure to gather the cross and then lay it off to gallagher there j mateta o douard mateta is also on for edouard who has been extremely quiet l milivojevi e eze milivojevic is coming on for eze as vieira makes a very defensive change here gross delivers a cross from the right and trossard meets it with a thumping first time volley it s well blocked by andersen though and cleared away gross puts in a good delivery from a corner and webster rises highest to head it goalwards maupay tries to turn it in at the far post but the ball just evades him lamptey has looked lively since coming on he beats mitchell on the right with some quick feet and wins a free kick in a decent position for his side w hughes yellow card mac allister is aggressively wiped out by hughes as the palace man attempted to inject some urgency into proceedings the referee plays advantage but goes back to put hughes in the book afterwards olise picks up a stray pass and drives towards the brighton defence he just can t quite pick out a pass ahead of him when palace had numbers forward and brighton clear t lamptey a lallana lallana hands over the captain s armband and walks off the pitch to be replaced by lamptey lallana is down on the pitch receiving treatment and it doesn t look like he ll be able to continue here eze dances into the box from the left flank and goes down under the attentions of a few brighton defenders the referee isn t interested however and nothing is given palace are able to settle on the ball with a rare spell of possession they give it away though and maupay races away with the ball down the centre he feeds trossard to his left but his goal bound effort is blocked and the visitors can clear another chance mac allister collects a cute backheel from maupay and plays moder in on goal with a lovely chipped through ball moder scuffs his effort though and butland tips it behind for a corner chance veltman picks the ball up on the right byline fizzes a cross into gross who smacks his volleyed effort off the crossbar from close range brighton get us back underway for the second half here palace can t expect to ride their luck for the whole of the second period however they only registered one shot in that first half and will have to commit more numbers to their attacks if they want to trouble sanchez in the brighton goal it s goalless at the break then after a half that really came to life in the last few minutes hughes decided to rugby tackle veltman in the box giving gross the opportunity to put his side up his tame effort was saved however only for maupay to score off the resulting corner his was disallowed for a foul on butland and palace stay level at the break half time brighton crystal palace cucurella drives down the left and cuts it back to trossard yards out from goal he curls a shot well over the bar however and that should be that for the first half butland skews a goal kick straight into touch as mitchell can t keep it in on the halfway line he s certainly had an eventful half the palace keeper there will be three minutes of additional time to be played here palace come away on the counter attack with olise surging down the left wing he delivers a good cross into the area but it s headed clear by burn e eze yellow card eze clatters into maupay as he tries to hold the palace man off the ball it s a free kick to brighton and eze goes into the referee s book no goal the referee goes over to the monitor himself and decides that it s a foul by maupay on butland palace escape from a crazy last few minutes and the score stays at goal butland goes from hero to villain in seconds butland makes an easy save from a soft header from a corner maupay is following in and kicks the ball right out from his hands on the goal line and into the goal there s a short var check but the goal stands j butland penalty save penalty saved it stays at gross steps up and hits a very tame and weak spot kick straight down the middle of the goal butland saves with his legs and the palace defence hack it clear p gro penalty miss penalty miss pascal gro the game is paused as the referee goes over to the var monitor to investigate a foul by hughes on veltman in the area from the corner the pictures show hughes dragged down veltman with his arm around his neck penalty given veltman fires a shot goalwards as palace can t clear their lines following a corner it deflects out to lallana who skews his effort over the bar gallagher surges down the right hand touchline struggling to retain possession and eventually ends up giving away a goal kick as he attempts to play the ball off his opposite man for a corner brighton work the ball from right to left in the palace half as the away side sit deep in two banks of four potter s men have so far been unable to create many opportunities of note though olise skips past his man on the right flank and feints to shoot before waiting slightly too long to pull the trigger and getting crowded out by the brighton defenders in the area webster crashes a header straight at the goalkeeper from the resulting corner the referee had blown his whistle though for a push on his opposite man moder delivers a deep cross from the right and ward has to turn it behind at the far post the crowd roar their encouragement at this recent spell of pressure from the hosts the hosts are starting to assert their dominance on this game now they have had four attempts on goal to palace s zero and have enjoyed per cent of possession so far veltman feeds moder down the line on the right and the midfielder cuts it back into ward who nearly deflects the ball into his own net palace manage to hack the ball clear however olise floats a dangerous looking cross in edouard from deep and the keeper drops the ball as the striker challenges him but the flag is up for offside and brighton have a free kick cucurella nails a beautiful yard cross field pass to gross as brighton come forward he slips it down the line to moder but his cross evades everyone and palace can regather possession webster finds gross out wide on the right with a well hit raking pass but gross handles it as he brings the ball down and gives away a cheap free kick to the opposition brighton seem intent on controlling possession here and the eagles are very content to set up to counter attack in reply schlupp advances down the left flank and delivers a dangerous ball in towards the near post which is thumped out of play for a throw in to the away side chance great save a dreadful header from ward means the ball is given straight to trossard who races in on goal with just the keeper to beat his shot towards the far post is well saved by butland however and the visitors escape gallagher is tripped after being surrounded by three brighton players on halfway and the visitors are awarded a free kick cucurella drives a cross in towards the six yard box after a neat short corner routine the ball is cleared but only as far as lallana who tries his luck with a speculative effort and the ball cannons off a palace defender and is cleared away mitchell slips in the corner of his own box trying to clear the ball and gives possession up to mac allister he whips in a dangerous cross but it s just about cleared by the palace defence the hosts are growing in confidence here lallana dances forward towards the area and tries to slip moder in on goal the ball is just cut out by the opposition defender as moder was through it s a cagey start here as neither side can get a real hold of possession palace can t expect to ride their luck for the whole of the second period however and will have to be willing to commit more numbers to their attacks if they want to trouble sanchez in the brighton goal brighton are in their usual blue and white stripes whereas palace are in all yellow it s the visitors who get us underway here just per cent of crystal palace s premier league points have been won in away games this season

suggestion of emmanuel dennis m now selected by a massive of fpl managers backfired spectacularly with the watford forward returning just two points after seeing one of his games from the anticipated double gameweek postponed that fixture against burnley a has been rearranged and slotted into gameweek although with there being no guarantee that both of the hornets games will go ahead it s probably a better idea to revert to a safer captain option who is more likely to produce a big score in their single fixture diogo jota m would therefore be our pick for this week the liverpool forward was in devastating form against arsenal in the carabao cup semi final and the fixture against crystal palace a is an appealing one three differential picks for gameweek jack harrison leeds midfielder mwith four goals from his last two games it s surprising that more fpl bosses haven t jumped on harrison and brought him in ahead of gameweek with his price remaining at m as a result while he s unlikely to repeat his point hat trick heroics from last week a home fixture against struggling newcastle gives him a decent opportunity to add to the points he s managed in total in the season jacob ramsey aston

wonder why he s selected by less than of fpl managers indeed at m ramsey is an absolute bargain and with villa having as many as six consecutive fixtures against teams in and around or below them in the table now would be the perfect time to invest in the young midfielder rayan ait nouri wolves defender mlast week s differential suggestion of jose sa paid dividends with the wolves goalkeeper claiming seven points from the win over southampton and we d implore you to follow a similar strategy this week and consider transferring in ait nouri the left back seems certain to keep his place in

quality or competitiveness it s a sneer that has grown in popularity among english fans who look down on countries where the title winners are seemingly known before the season even starts while the premier league generally kicks off with four or five teams believing they can challenge for top spot some feel that in the top flights in germany france and italy the champions can be easily predicted

s little brother finally realising potential at ac milan it s not over yet southampton give hope to liverpool and chelsea by showing that man city are not invincible for example anyone who has tipped bayern munich paris saint germain or juventus to win their respective leagues over the past nine years would have been correct per cent of the time the premier league by contrast has had five different winners during that time however with manchester city presently points clear at the top of the table midway through january there is an increasing concern that english football could be going in the same direction pep guardiola s side are heading towards what would be a fourth title in five years with their domination and control of games seeing the possibility of a three horse title race slipping away city extended their winning streak to matches on saturday with a victory over second placed chelsea who could only manufacture a single shot on target thomas tuchel had complained that the european champions were finding it difficult to stay in the title race and now it seems that only liverpool points behind with a game in hand have any hope of overhauling the runaway leaders manchester city chelseacity open up a point gap at the top of the premier league pic twitter com kssfwgvb goal january so is the premier league becoming a procession is it in reality no more competitive than the bundesliga or ligue before attempting to answer those questions it s worth pointing out that football fans in germany france and italy might take issue with the jibe believing teams have had to fight harder for title glory than english fans believe bayern have won the last nine bundesliga titles but the season was only settled on the final day while neither psg nor juve are currently the reigning champions of france or italy respectively it s also worth remembering that dominance is cyclical and hardly a new phenomenon even in england aston villa in the s arsenal in the s liverpool in the late s and early s and manchester united on three occasions between and all won four titles in the space of five years city have been superb since guardiola s difficult first season in manchester but they are hardly so far ahead of their rivals that the title race was considered a foregone conclusion in august champions league winners chelsea were expected to mount a serious challenge after adding million m striker romelu lukaku to a squad that beat city three times at the end of the last campaign liverpool were expected to challenge again with virgil van dijk back from long term injury to take charge of the defence while even manchester united were considered challengers after adding cristiano ronaldo jadon sancho and raphael varane to a side that had finished second while united imploded spectacularly and rapidly chelsea and liverpool looked well placed to sustain title challengers indeed on december just two points separated the blues the reds and city however chelsea have won just four of their last premier league matches while sunday s win over brentford was liverpool s first in four outings liverpool are currently on course for a total of points which would only be enough to guarantee two titles this decade chelsea s projected total of points would not be enough to win any premier league in its history but the title race is far from over liverpool have a game in hand and a trip to the etihad stadium that if won would reduce the gap to just five points and jurgen klopp s side are more than capable of putting together a winning streak to put city under pressure the champions form may be intimidating but they are certainly not unbeatable just ask crystal palace who deservedly won at the etihad stadium or southampton or wolves who can point to controversial refereeing decisions for failing to do the same and what about arsenal who were the better side in a self inflicted defeat on new year s day or leicester tottenham and west ham who have all beaten city in different competitions this season of course guardiola s side have started to push the bar in terms of what s required at the very top should they reach a projected points it would only be for the fifth time in premier league history but all five instances occurred in the last five years city twice and liverpool twice guardiola will get plenty of credit from his club s fans for their brutal and relentless dominance but there will always be detractors ready to snipe at city s achievements when it comes to their success sooner or later the subject of money will come up the wealthiest clubs have generally always been the most decorated city are certainly no different having spent more than anyone else since sheikh mansour took over the club in with huge amounts lavished on star players to give guardiola the quality to mould his side into a machine against chelsea other than academy graduate phil foden every player cost more than m m however tuchel s squad was hardly compiled on a shoestring and while he complained that city had coped better with covid and injuries eight of his nine substitute options were full internationals while four of guardiola s bench had played three minutes in the premier league between them so as strong as city s squad undeniably is there are plenty of holes after all they are going through an entire season without a natural striker or an orthodox left back even if joao cancelo has been exceptional since being thrust into the role city wanted harry kane in the summer but when it became clear that he wouldn t leave tottenham a decision was made to continue with what they had rather than buying a misfit in the hope they might be a success ronaldo s desire to quit juve saw him saw him emerge as an option but city s interest ended when united were spooked into a panic buy city decided to regroup to wait until summer before making a far more sensible purchase united are an example of a club that have made several costly errors in the transfer market in recent years not least paying crazy fees or massive wages for players such as alexis sanchez harry maguire and fred all of whom were wanted by city but dropped when the numbers involved in the proposed deals sky rocketed sitting seventh in the premier league with an interim manager and players wanting to leave united are the counter argument to the old adage that money buys success they are proof that financial power is only a factor if you re capable of spending shrewdly city are certainly in the middle of a golden period but history suggests that they are highly unlikely to stay there forever particularly given the quality of rivals such as liverpool and chelsea who have won two of the last three champions league between them guardiola had incredible success with barcelona and bayern munich but is under no illusions what it takes to keep his squad motivated to keep them at the top to win and win in this country in this league this is my best title i have and the best i will have when i leave was his conclusion after beating chelsea on saturday as far as guardiola is concerned the premier league is certainly no

scores transfers romain emperor psg transfer target faivre ready for the big time robin bairner am est the brest midfielder has impressed ligue audiences with his elegance and now a move to psg could be on the cards romain faivre is certainly not a young man lacking in confidence he has been in the news for two primary reasons in january firstly an impudent panenka against a covid stricken bordeaux side in the coupe de france infuriated brest s ligue rivals who felt that he was purposely humiliating them days later rumours over a potential move to paris saint germain began to circulate editors picks from title glory to a m divorce inside conte s tumultuous chelsea tenure is rafael leao really the new henry ibrahimovic s little brother finally realising potential at ac milan it s not over yet southampton give hope to liverpool and chelsea by showing that man city are not invincible rashford revives man utd s top four challenge as rangnick s gamble pays off against west ham the brest midfielder has spent the last months entertaining ligue fans with his graceful brand of football impressing at a club that traditionally does not earn much media coverage or garner much interest he has brought both but while psg are set to have a restrained transfer window the former monaco youth player appears on the shortlist of the parc des princes side this january speaking to canal he has made it clear he would be open to a move to play for psg there s been contact with my agent he explained a week ago it s a dream it s my city my family and my friends are there previously he had been heavily courted by serie a club milan only for the deal to break down as the italians offer of million m m was deemed insufficient view this post on instagram certainly with his easy technique and graceful style he would have been a fitting addition to the rossoneri ranks and he made it clear to brest that he was not happy at being unable to leave for san siro indeed he was even exiled from the squad on one occasion as a result of his outspoken nature which player in the brest squad would not be flattered by ac milan s interest he told ouest france i had contact with them but i m not obsessed i made it clear that in football i have high goals and ambitions if faivre is assured in his own ability he has been wise enough to build a team around him that will allow him to thrive he has his own physical trainer a mental trainer a nutritionist almost like one would expect from an individual athlete i m just preparing to be above the others i pay attention to my physique my diet my sleep i m putting all these little details together to help me get to a team like ac milan he said he left monaco at the age of having played just four first team games and there was little widespread expectation on him when he arrived at brest in the summer of his background work though clearly did the trick he hit the ground running scoring four goals and creating three more before christmas and even if he faded a little in the second half of the campaign he had shown enough to persuade milan to make an approach his influence has only grown this season albeit it has been dulled by playing in a side that has struggled to excel nevertheless with seven goals and five assists he has already beaten his scoring tally from last season and lies just one short in the other statistic perhaps what has been most impressive about the left sided player is that he has been equally effective in a number of different roles over the past months an ability to play left centre or right midfield in an attacking style offers versatility while his dribbling qualities mean he has the capacity to open up tightly packed defences given that he is no slouch defensively there is a lot to like about his game he will not be easy to capture with a contract that runs until all the power lies with brest and they have indicated they do not want to sell we re calm sporting director gregory lorenzi told l equipe at the end of december we want to keep romain until the end of the season and we don t want him to leave this winter but if there s an offer we can t refuse we ll study it our first thought is that he ll stay and we ll reanalyse his situation next summer a move to psg would doubtless be a big step up but faivre has shown he has it in his locker to prove his doubters wrong while he has the focus and professional attitude that could take him far in the game he could prove a fine addition to the parc des princes club which has been leaning on kylian mbappe far too heavily for too long

of a win against brentford and that will have only added to his fury what happened as he left the pitch set the tone for the post match discussion as the year old threw a strop there was a pat on the back for maguire as he replaced him but no eye contact it was the same for manager ralf rangnick a shake of the hand but the forward wasn t interested in pleasantries he was handed a coat which he started to put on while he muttered to those around him before he threw the coat on the ground and took a seat on the concrete step of the dugout those sat behind him glanced to look in his direction but there were no arms of support or words of motivation as he sat simmering and sipping from his water bottle why was i brought off he consistently asked assistant chris armas and technical director darren fletcher the game had restarted but the majority of the eyes of those sat in the south stand were fixated on the forward as he demanded an answer for his removal ronaldo shaking his head and

half pic twitter com wjgbxbosv charlotte duncker january six minutes later as the squad celebrated marcus rashford s goal rangnick sat down and put his hand on ronaldo s arm explaining his decision i said cristiano you re still ambitious and you want to score yourself but maybe in a couple of years when you re a head coach yourself you will hopefully make the same decision and be in the same role i was today after minutes rangnick explained afterwards ex manager ole gunnar solskjaer was accused of not bringing ronaldo off in games where he wasn t performing to the best of his ability but rangnick to his credit has no issue with substituting the portugal international it was a tactical substitution that worked on the night and he would have no problem making the same decision again the german joked he did not expect a hug from the forward when he made the decision and insists there is no problem between them so is it really as big a deal as it has been made out it is understood the staff and players weren t offended by ronaldo s reaction and rangnick understood it the five time ballon d or winner has history of throwing his toys out of the pram at every club he has played for his reaction when he was brought off in the manchester derby at old trafford was far more dramatic than his coat throwing petulance in west london his interviews last week questioned the mentality of some of the squad players and he doubted if they wanted to learn from the more experienced heads in the dressing room there will be many that would argue that throwing a strop when you re brought off isn t the example to lead by but on the flip side it shows a passion and desire to always contribute it is that mentality which has seen him score over career goals and has him still playing at the top level at he has been at the top of his game for so long that his siuuuu celebration has transcended football boundaries and is currently being heard at the australian open much to the annoyance of some of the world s top tennis stars he has a cult following that means whatever he does others will follow some will argue that he should know better than to be behaving petulantly on the sidelines during a game that is being broadcast around the world but for those close to him it is no issue it highlights his passion and he always strives to be percent professional ronaldo is guaranteed to be brought off on other occasions between now and the end of the season the debate will no doubt air again because he s never going to willingly skip down the tunnel when he sees his number is up it

lindelof his clearance then hits greenwood and bounces out of play konsa has gone down during a corner for villa and it looks like he was accidentally caught in the face by shaw his nose is bleeding so the medical team are on to patch him up but he ll be able to carry on after treatment j lingard bruno fernandes there s a double change here for united and fernandes is taking his time going off as he goes across to give de gea the armband he s replaced by lingard j philogene bidace j ramsey and the second change for villa sees ramsey taken off with philogene bidace on for him a elanga m rashford rashford is the other player making way with elanga on in his place it s better from united now as they re just keeping possession high upfield in villa s half mctominay has space to run into and he s urged to shoot by the fans but he spreads it out wide to fernandes who can t pick out a cross it looks like fernandes is trying to run down the clock a little as he delays the corner by tying his shoelace and he s told to hurry up by the referee it s a poor cross into the middle when he eventually takes it with mings heading it away under no pressure a el ghazi e buend a first change for villa now as they continue to push for an equaliser it s buendia that s going off with el ghazi on to replace him cash loses out to rashford and his touch sets fernandes off through the middle he tries to get rashford in behind villa with an early throughball but there s too much on it and it s an easy one for mings to deal with it s another great move by villa as they play out from the back and luiz picks out ings on the right a heavy first touch lets him down though and it bounces straight to varane who clears the danger great chance greenwood breaks quickly down the right and targett just can t get anywhere near him it s a tight angle for him on the right but he gets it on target and martinez shovels it away rashford is in the middle and the ball is there to be won but the forward doesn t react leaving it for martinez to collect d van de beek e cavani united are making the first change of the game and it s well received by the fans van de beek comes onto a warm reception as he replaces cavani close united don t clear their lines properly from the free kick and cash fizzes a dangerous low cross in from the right mctominay blocks it but it only goes as far as watkins he whips a shot towards the far post but it s just wide of the far post diogo dalot yellow card yellow card jos diogo dalot teixeira l shaw yellow card yellow card luke shaw l shaw yellow card shaw blocks off watkins run just in front of the referee and he s booked for the challenge great save fred s clearance falls kindly for cash who is all on his own just outside the box he has time to take a touch before swerving a shot towards the near post it takes the slightest of nicks off varane before de gea pushes it wide for a corner fred yellow card yellow card frederico rodrigues de paula santos fred yellow card fred is overstretching as he tries to get across to luiz the ball is long gone by the time he trips luiz though and his name goes into the book konsa finds himself high upfield and he makes a brilliant driving run into the box breezing past the united defenders he slips just as he goes to take the shot and it ends up being a comfortable one for de gea at his near post united are really up against it at the moment with villa continuing to pile the pressure on the hosts just can t get out of their own half at the minute but shaw buys them a bit of respite when he wins a free kick when cash nudges him in the back lindelof crashed into the post as him and watkins both chased down ings shot and he s receiving treatment just off the pitch it was a heavy collision but he s quickly back to his feet and it looks like he ll be able to carry on offside it s a lovely move from villa with mcginn sliding a great throughball forward for ings he drives into the box before chipping an effort over de gea who was rushing off his line it s heading wide but watkins is following it in and beats lindelof there to poke it over the line ings was offside in the build up though and this one won t count either there are some sloppy passes creeping in from both sides here and it s united creating their own problems at the moment luiz threads it into the box and mctominay loses it mcginn latches onto it but then hits his shot straight against his international team mate the frustration starts to boil over for villa mcginn was caught by fernandes and thought the portuguese should be shown a yellow card which never came he then steps across fred with a very late challenge and the united fans think he should go into the book but the referee keeps his cards in his pocket no goal it s been cleared up that watkins didn t take a touch before ings reached it s not going to be ruled out for offside michael oliver has now been asked to go over and have a look at the monitor though as ramsey blocked off cavani s run when the original cross was coming into the box that s judged to be a foul and the goal won t stand after a very lengthy var check still united var is having a very long look at the replays of the goal to see if watkins made contact with the ball before ings nodded it over the line it s taking a long time to come to a conclusion here ings equalises mcginn wins a free kick down the right and he steps up to take it he whips a deep cross into the box and it loops over the top to konsa who nods it back across goal watkins is just in front of de gea and the keeper misses it with ings behind him to nod it over the line from very close range var is having a look at this one though cavani looks surprised when the ball bounces straight to him after a loose touch from mcginn but he threads it through for fernandes down the left he squares it to rashford just inside the box and his flick on deflects out for a corner off konsa villa get us back underway for the second half despite going into half time ahead united arguably should be behind considering the attempts they ve conceded rangnick will be pleased with their attacking play but they need to tighten up at the back if they want to see this out villa have done everything bar score so far and gerrard will be hoping for more of the same in the second half mctominay s early header gives united a lead over villa at half time it was a bright start by the hosts and they got their reward when mctominay nodded fred s brilliant cross past martinez villa came to life after that and had the best chances with watkins rattling the crossbar after lindelof s mistake and mcginn forcing de gea into a great save martinez has also been busy though making good saves to keep out fernandes and shaw half time manchester united aston villa rashford breaks down the right and there s so much space for him to run into he takes it to the byline and tries to square it to greenwood who isn t being picked up on the far side he left it too late though and targett gets back to block the cross rashford has switched out to the right and he times his run perfectly to get on the end of mctominay s long ball over the top he squares it to cavani who holds off konsa before teeing up fernandes but his shot is always rising as it sails over the bar save rashford hits a long range free kick against mctominay in front of the wall but shaw keeps hold of it for the hosts he lifts it into mctominay who catches it sweetly on the volley keeping it low it s straight at martinez though and the keeper gets behind it it s a loose touch by luiz and cavani is behind him to pick it up for united he turns and breaks quickly on the counter sweeping it out to shaw on the left it s a poor cross from him though as he sends it straight into martinez s gloves the visitors are taking a risk as they play it between konsa mings and martinez in their own box cavani and fernandes are keeping the pressure on for united but villa don t panic and manage to play it out from the back without causing any of their own problems great save greenwood isn t picked up and he floats a dangerous cross in which is blocked by mings it goes to fernandes and the defender makes an important block to keep him out it falls for shaw who drills a powerful shot on goal and martinez tips it over the bar greenwood tries to play it inside to fred but it s a poor pass that s instantly cut out by targett luiz tries to catch the hosts out with an early throughball into the box but dalot is there to cut it out ahead of watkins the medical team have finally stemmed the bleeding of dalot s cut and he s going to be able to carry on luiz takes the corner for villa and it s glanced on by buendia to ings directly behind him he gets caught under it and his header loops over dalot has gone down for united and it looks like he s got a bad cut on his ankle the medical team are on to try and patch him up but rangnick is getting wan bissaka warmed up on the sidelines in case he s needed close villa are really starting to up the pressure on united now as cash floats a dangerous cross into the box targett heads it back to ramsey on the edge of the box he hits the shot first time but mctominay s deflection takes it just wide of the near post off the bar mings hooks it upfield and it looks like it s an easy one for lindelof to deal with until it bounces off his knee and into his own box watkins pounces onto it before turning away from lindelof who was desperately trying to recover the forward whips a shot towards goal and it thumps the underside of the bar before shaw hooks it away good save there s a mix up between luiz and ramsey which fernandes benefits from as he breaks on the counter before laying it off to cavani on the right of the box he goes for goal with his low shot taking a slight nick off konsa and martinez reacts quickly to push it away it s well worked from right to left by villa and luiz threads it through for watkins his back is to goal so he touches it into buendia and he has a go from distance he can t get the power behind it though and it s held by de gea greenwood gets away from targett with a drop of the shoulder to cut inside and tries to knock it past konsa as well the defender gets a touch on it that causes it to bounce awkwardly in front of greenwood and he ends up firing his shot high into the stands villa are enjoying a good spell of possession but it s all in their own half united are just sitting back for now inviting the visitors to push forward but they can t find a way out at the moment fernandes is trying to put the pressure on martinez but the goalkeeper coolly clears his lines picking out mcginn through the middle he lifts a long ball over the top for cash to chase but there s too much on it and de gea collects good save ramsey pulls it back for mcginn and mctominay sits back not challenging him the space opens up so he has a go from range and it s a great effort it s swerving towards goal but de gea is equal to it as he pushes it away with a strong hand cash is in quickly on rashford and he plays a one two with mcginn to get away down the right for villa he lifts a deep cross into the box but everyone had crowded onto the near post so it bounces out for a throw in on the opposite side united are pushing forward again and they re trying to use rashford who is pulling out very wide on the left he cuts inside again and whips the ball into the box it comes at cavani too quickly and hits the forward on the head before looping away from goal chance buendia dribbles his way past three united defenders to get into the box before shrugging off lindelof to get into a shooting position he drills a low shot across goal and ings is following in at the far post but he can t get a touch to tap it into the empty net j ramsey yellow card ramsey is a bit late with his challenge on dalot and the referee shows him an early yellow card j ramsey yellow card yellow card jacob ramsey watkins buendia whips a dangerous cross into the six yard box and it catches everybody out at the near post lindelof heads it away off the line and it hits watkins who can t sort his feet out quick enough and he sends it wide on the far side villa have a corner of their own at the other end as they try to get themselves level again it s whipped in deep towards konsa at the far post but shaw just does enough to put him off but it goes out off the defender fred assist assist frederico rodrigues de paula santos s mctominay goal goal scott mctominay fred assist fred turned away from mcginn and he had time to get his head up before putting a wonderful cross onto the edge of the six yard box for mctominay s mctominay goal mctominay scores fernandes scuffs a volley towards goal after being picked out from a corner which luiz clears but it goes straight back to fred just outside the box he plays a one two with greenwood before curling a brilliant cross into the middle and mctominay rises highest to just nod it past martinez and into the back of the net united chance fred breaks up villa s attack and mctominay switches it out to rashford wide on the left he drags it inside trying to find an opening before he hits a shot against mings the rebound falls for mctominay whose long range shot is straight at martinez rashford can t latch onto fernandes lay off and cash hooks the ball upfield varane misses the clearance and buendia picks it up down the right but he runs straight into shaw when he tries to cut inside shaw goes long to fernandes down the left but he s not given a lot of time as konsa is closing in on him the defender recovers brilliantly to stick out a leg and hit the cross back against fernandes to win a goal kick fernandes gets

premier league glory chelsea s relationship with antonio conte ended in court and ultimately cost the blues million m making it the most costly divorce in football history when the blues sacked the italian in they argued that he was not entitled to the usual severance package because of alleged breaches of contract during his second and final year at stamford bridge the judges ruled in conte s favour though and he split the compensation received with his staff members editors picks romain emperor psg transfer target faivre ready for the big time is rafael leao really the new henry ibrahimovic s little brother finally realising potential at ac milan it s not over yet southampton give hope to liverpool and chelsea by showing that man city are not invincible rashford revives man utd s top four challenge as rangnick s gamble pays off against west ham it was a shame that the coach s time in west london had ended in such acrimony and surprising too given it had started so promisingly indeed in his first year in charge conte transformed a side that had finished th the season before into premier league champions a switch to a formation which hadn t often been seen in england sparked a game winning run that led to his side romping to the title the blues went close to pulling off a domestic double in but they were beaten in the fa cup final by arsenal however they would return to wembley the following year to lift the trophy following a victory over manchester united two major trophies in two seasons would normally guarantee at least another year at the helm for a manager but conte s tenure had already began to unravel before the end of the campaign the first signs of tension at stamford bridge actually appeared during the january transfer window after diego costa pushed for a m m move to chinese super league club tianjin quanjian the blues forced the brazil born spain international to stay put and he played a key role in their subsequent title triumph however conte then informed costa that he was not part of his future plans via text message while the striker was on holiday costa was furious and partook in several interviews where he claimed he had been treated like a dog inside the club many blamed conte for his insensitive handling of the situation and believed he should have let club director marina granovskaia deal with costa s exit nonetheless after their title success which secured a return to the champions league chelsea sought to strengthen a squad that conte did not believe was sufficiently equipped to challenge for trophies in both england and europe the blues brought in several players but not necessarily all of those on conte s ambitious wishlist having already been left disappointed by seeing top target virgil van dijk leave southampton for liverpool for a then record fee for a defender m m conte was further frustrated by missing out on leonardo bonucci who left juventus for ac milan in the summer of conte was also keen on alex oxlade chamberlain romelu lukaku and kyle walker while the blues also had an significant bid turned down for ac milan s alessio romagnoli and even approached bayern munich s robert lewandowski during the lecce native s time at the club however for the campaign chelsea had instead brought in alvaro morata tiemoue bakayoko danny drinkwater and davide zappacosta in what many believe to be the club s most disastrous transfer window in recent times unsurprisingly chelsea were quickly left behind by manchester city in the title race and in november influential technical director michael emenalo left the club by mutual consent which was hugely significant as it meant that the mediator between conte and granovskaia was removed from the equation what followed almost inevitably was a series of bitter and depressing press conferences in which conte publicly expressed his unhappiness with chelsea s transfer business chelsea are still counting the cost of the campaign to this day as the january arrivals of olivier giroud emerson palmieri and ross barkley took their overall outlay that season to m m the blues did still lift the fa cup but they finished fifth in the premier league which saw them fall back out of the champions league it quickly became clear during the summer that followed that chlesea wanted to bring in maurizio sarri as their new manager but his arrival was held up by napoli s ultimately successful attempt to make the m m signing of jorginho part of the deal as it was though conte was actually forced to take the first three training sessions of the new season as he awaited his fate he arguably deserved better but looking back at the whole affair it would be unfair to portray either side as a hero or villain it was just another dramatic episode in the turbulent world of chelsea who have forked out around m m in severance pay to sacked managers since roman abramovich bought the club in conte for his part has always been reluctant to shed much light on his chelsea tenure i spent two seasons where i created a good relationship with players staff people who work at chelsea the now tottenham coach said ahead of the first of three meetings with his former employers this month we did a really good job and i think in my position i don t have to prove anything to anyone i m a manager that has the experience to do

forward under his wing even leao soon began referring to the swedish striking icon as his big brother since he arrived he s been talking to me giving me advice on how to improve how to position myself in the penalty area the portuguese explained he s a great player and i want to learn as much as i can with him by my side ibrahimovic though felt that too much of what he was telling leao was going in one ear and out the other no matter what he said he couldn t quite seem to get through to leao to make him realise just what was expected of a top professional then during the summer leao totally changed as ibrahimovic put it he understood himself what to do the swede told corriere tv for leao the penny had dropped he couldn t get by just turning it on for minutes here and there he accepted what ibrahimovic milan coach stefano pioli his parents and his personal trainer were all telling him he needed to be on it each and every week for minutes god has given me the talent which is rare but i must add sacrifices and hard work he admitted in an interview with la repubblica in november i have a talent to cultivate but you don t play alone in football and i ve proved that i can make it at milan he s most certainly done that over the past few months rafael leao comes up big for ac milan pic twitter com vugvcamdv goal january just over halfway through the campaign leao has as many goals in all competitions eight as he s ever previously managed as a professional over the course of an entire season in addition he s also contributed four assists has completed more dribbles than any other player based in serie a and is now set to be rewarded with a bumper new contract the upturn in form has also resulted in the mbappe comparisons resurfacing but stefano pioli feels leao is more similar to another famous french forward he reminds me a lot of thierry henry the milan coach told reporters earlier this month given pioli is hardly a man renowned for making outlandish statements the comparison provoked plenty of debate in italy however it has been backed up by the likes of nicola amoruso and alessio tacchinardi both of whom were on juventus books when henry spent six months in turin in the young henry is the leao of today tacchinardi told tuttosport the characteristics of the two players are the same you see the pace in one on ones and they always go on the outside to break through the opponent s defence i was slaughtered on social media for this comparison but just compare the videos and there s nothing else to say they re the same amoruso is in total agreement but he added in an interview with the gazzetta dello sport leao just has to better understand how strong he is once he does this nobody will stop him and this leads us on to the great contradiction in leao s character for all of his faith in his natural talent he still doesn t seem to have fully grasped just how far he can go italian coaching icon fabio capello and pioli have also said the same thing leao doesn t yet realise the enormity of his potential still it s clear from both recent statements and recent performances that the player himself has at least started to see the merits of adding industry to innovation i think he has to convince himself and work a lot on his mentality to try to become even more ambitious added pioli whom leao views as a reference point in his career one with his means must think of getting to the top of the world but talent is not enough he understands that he has to work in a certain way and work with others encouragingly leao now forms one of the most formidable left flanks in europe alongside theo hernandez with the pair combining to devastating effect to torment opposition right backs indeed how juventus cope with milan s dual threat out wide will go a long way towards determining the outcome of sunday s massive serie a showdown at san siro leao is clearly not the finished article he cannot be compared to the henry that arsene wenger transformed into arguably the finest attacking talent the premier league has ever seen still there are undeniable similarities to the henry that toiled in turin for six months there is the sensational speed the devastating dribbling skills and the valuable versatility of course a key difference is that while leao is flourishing out wide under pioli henry floundered under ancelotti however as tacchinardi pointed out the portugal international is another diamond in the rough one that could yet be polished into something quite spectacular and the signs are that after a couple of seasons of frustration which required an immense amount of patience from pioli co milan are finally well placed to succeed with leao where juve failed with henry contact us terms of service privacy policy

ligue s hottest striking prospects after scoring four times in his last four games it may not have been a new year s resolution exactly but rafael leao s promise to himself to hit new heights in has started impressively the year old lille attacker arrived in france as a free agent after ending his contract with sporting cp after fans stormed the training centre though his start to life in ligue was hampered by injuries the youngster is showing the kind of form that justified the excitement around his arrival in northern france he has scored four times in his last four matches and five overall in just minutes on the field making him the club s leading marksman behind the duo of nicolas pepe and jonathan bamba whose marginal slide in form lately has been barely noticeable due to the poaching capabilities of their young comrade editors picks from title glory to a m divorce inside conte s tumultuous chelsea tenure romain emperor psg transfer target faivre ready for the big time is rafael leao really the new henry ibrahimovic s little brother finally realising potential at ac milan it s not over yet southampton give hope to liverpool and chelsea by showing that man city are not invincible i m ready he told portuguese newspaper record on january and it seems that he certainly is leao was born in almada to angolan parents and has been immersed in football for his entire life i met him when he was and few people understood his way of playing tiago fernandes now a coach at chaves but a man who was leao s mentor told france football he was doing things with the ball that no one could do but he still forgot his positioning on the field branded the best player in the history of the sporting academy by fernandes above even cristiano ronaldo he debuted for the first team as an year old nutmegged the great iker casillas as he scored against porto but left in the aftermath of coach jorge jesus s fall out with president bruno de carvalho he s the portuguese mbappe lille president gerard lopez told rmc as he celebrated beating off the likes over dortmund and benfica for the player s signature lopez though was also forced to bat off claims from sporting that they were owed the million m m value of the player s release clause a fight that lille subsequently won the player meanwhile has been doing his best to shrug off comparisons to the paris saint germain wonderkid who scored twice in the world cup final to help france to glory mbappe is mbappe he s an incredible player he s and has already proven a good deal i m rafael leao and i must work and prove myself and today i m with lille to do that and to progress he said in december but like the french superstar the player s father antonio has had a big influence in his career indeed had the teenager had things his way he might have been back at sporting but his father and agent guided him to france he wanted to come back here but they did not bring him back sousa cintra acting president of sporting told sic noticias the agent has a red card and cannot set foot back here we were ready to negotiate with big clubs and now he s stuck in lille when he could have gone to real madrid antonio was so keen on a move to lille though because of the way they have nurtured youngsters in the past like eden hazard and more recently pepe and bamba head coach christophe galtier meanwhile is anxious that he earned his right to play and did not start purely because of his up and coming reputation he was starting to lose his patience to get upset in training because there were matches he could have come on in but circumstances didn t allow it the coach accepted after handing him his first start in which he scored against caen he s a player who can make you pull your hair out but a few minutes later bring you a lot of hope and a smile now however his flurry of goals have cemented him as lille s no for the foreseeable future i m very happy he admitted after bagging another against amiens last weekend it s important for me it gives me extra motivation to continue working and to give the best of myself as galtier concedes leao is far from the finished product with the coach eager to see him more efficient defensively and that sense of positioning that fernandes joked about still with room for improvement yet the raw materials for excellence are prevalent like his lille cohorts he is fast and technical able to play wide if required yet his strength in the air is greater than that of losc s other starters for a young player to have so much maturity in front of goal is impressive while his understanding of lille s gameplan is growing he s progressing and working a lot galtier said relationships with other players are being struck up he s present and effective in the box i believe he s started seven times and already has five goals mbappe he may not be but if he lives up to his new year promise then the name of rafael leao will be one that strikes fear into ligue defences contact us

full time on the stadio olimpico grass after england s thrashing of ukraine it was one great striker acknowledging the undoubted quality of another less than five minutes after the game had started

finally realising potential at ac milan it s not over yet southampton give hope to liverpool and chelsea by showing that man city are not invincible a natural born goalscorer shevchenko could only watch on helplessly as his team tried and failed to stop kane the tottenham forward was only denied a hat trick by a brilliant save from georgiy bushchan who got his fingertips to an outrageous yard volley and by gareth southgate who replaced him with dominic calvert lewin ahead of wednesday s semi final with denmark at wembley stadium after the destruction of ukraine in rome england are now coming home and it is kane who is ready to put an end to the year wait for a major senior trophy if southgate s side were to have any chance of success at euro it always seemed unlikely they would be able to achieve it without the help of kane but less than a fortnight ago people were beginning to question the striker after a lacklustre start to the tournament injuries fatigue speculation over a summer move to manchester city all were blamed for an underwhelming impression in three mediocre group stage performances at wembley as an ac milan goalscoring legend shevchenko knows himself that strikers go through difficult spells but the elite always get back to doing what they do best southgate never doubted that kane would come good and his unwavering backing has been rewarded after failing to hit the net in his opening three games kane now has three in his last two matches who would bet against him overtaking cristiano ronaldo and patrik schick on five goals and claiming another golden boot only trailing gary lineker by a single goal on the all time list of goals by an england player at tournaments kane now has nine goals in finals underlining why he is the man for the big occasion the blanks he drew in those opening matches against croatia scotland and the czech republic will have weighed heavy on the shoulders of a player who thrives on leading his country that was all lifted by the crucial late goal in the last victory over germany when a bitter rival was beaten and an ineffectual start to the tournament could be forgotten and against ukraine kane was back to his supreme best ruthless with his finishing lively with his running hungry for the ball dropping deep picking off long passes and inspiring all around him with raheem sterling again driving at opponents from wide and central positions and luke shaw delivering accurate crosses england are looking increasingly menacing for periods of the second half they were virtually unstoppable referee felix brych called off the contest on behalf of a shattered ukraine by ending the game as soon as he could barely seconds after the clock ticked past the minutes confidence is suddenly seeping through england behind the forwards is an ease and control that is consistently shutting down any threats from opponents more than minutes into the tournament england are yet to concede a goal with john stones and harry maguire forming a solid partnership in the centre of defence shielded by the guile of declan rice and kalvin phillips the only times they have looked like conceding were from unforced errors kyle walker and jordan pickford were sloppy once each against ukraine as england are clicking into gear and scoring more goals southgate is still facing a selection dilemma the england boss has so far rotated his third forward alongside kane and sterling and no one seems certain of taking the spot phil foden jack grealish bukayo saka and marcus rashford have all taken on the role in the tournament so far and against ukraine it was jadon sancho s turn coming in from the cold the new manchester united man sparkled in moments with his brilliant individual skill but it was not quite the standout performance he might have hoped for each of southgate s options offer something different though and the manager has shown the flexibility to manoeuvre his side to suit their opponents it seems odd to be heading into the semis without a settled side but it might suit the england coach to have all his players ready to step in kane on the other hand is simply untouchable and is determined to make the most of this huge opportunity as england return to wembley it s there for us it s an opportunity for us and we have to grab it with both hands he said we have to enjoy being in that environment coming off the back of the germany game the spirits were high and the stadium was rocking so hopefully we can use that energy again and really take the game to denmark the striker has minutes left to make himself one of england s greatest of all time and he is hitting form just at just the right time to do so contact us terms of service privacy policy copyright goal united states

at the lusail stadium return to top what stadiums will be used for the world cup among the many questions being asked about the tournament is how exactly a country of million approximately one sixth the size of ireland is going to welcome the world this will be the last world cup with teams so qatar will not at least have to deal with an expanded field but the country s government an extremely wealthy monarchy still expects to spend between to billion on the world cup and that is substantially less than the budget initially touted the original plan was to have stadiums ready to host games but the number has been reduced to eight the showpiece venue will be the lusail iconic stadium which will host the final and has the largest proposed capacity by far at over the eight stadiums that will be used are al bayt stadium al janoub stadium al rayyan stadium al thumama stadium education city stadium khalifa international stadium lusail stadium ras abu aboud stadium it is hoped that all stadiums will be completed in yasser al mulla from the supreme committee for delivery legacy told reporters in january that all the stadiums will be completed two years before the tournament starts

return to top when does world cup qualification start the first world cup qualification schedule to get under way was the afc section which began in june the caf section started in september public health concerns related to the global coronavirus pandemic meant that a number of cycles had their schedules interrupted but qualification will resume in august september and october uefa qualification will not begin until qatar will qualify automatically as hosts but they participate in the early rounds of asian qualifying anyway because it also acts as a route into the asian cup whether they then continue into the final stage should they progress that far is yet to be decided return to top when do world cup tickets go on sale you ll be waiting a long while for these yet world

in the middle to meet it he thumps a header towards goal but it smacks off the crossbar l boy assist two madrid defenders were trying to close him down and he spun away from them to get out of trouble and add an assist to his goal pere milla goal milla scores it s a lovely bit of skill from boye to get away from his defenders before he plays in milla on the right of the box nobody s picking him up and he has time to get it out of his feet before hitting it across goal and into the far side of the net elche madrid are patiently working their way upfield again and vinicius curls another cross in from the left hazard tries to cushion it down for jovic but gifts it straight to guti vin cius j nior yellow card vinicius slides in on the back of milla to stop his run he s pleading his innocence but the referee shows him a yellow card which means he ll miss the next match miss it s another great jinking run from hazard that gets them in behind before he touches it to modric he picks out mendy and he tees up vincius he drags it away from palacios before curling his shot wide of the far post it s a loose pass from gumbau in midfield that gifts the ball to modric and the madrid players flood upfield it s switched out to mendy on the left but again he can t pick out a team mate alaba is taking measures into his own hands here as he ventures higher up the pitch and curls a low cross into the box he s looking for vinicius in the middle but it s hooked away by verdu the elche fans and players aren t happy as they think they should ve had a penalty when milla goes to ground he got sandwiched between mendy and alaba but there wasn t enough in that and the referee waves the claims away rodrygo t kroos second change for madrid now and it s kroos that s going off for rodrygo chance mendy pulls a great ball back from the byline which is just out of casemiro s reach and hazard s touch hits it against gumbau it falls for kroos instead and he tries to swerve it into the top corner with the outside of the boot but it flies high and wide madrid break quickly on the counter again and kroos tries to lift an early cross over the top to jovic he s alone on the penalty spot but gonzalez reads it well and gets across to intercept l jovi k benzema madrid are making their first change of the game and it s an enforced one benzema goes straight down the tunnel holding his hamstring with jovic coming on to replace him it s swept out to palacios and he has acres of space to run into down the right he floats an early cross into the box for milla who backheels it over his head he doesn t get it quite right though and it bounces kindly into courtois gloves fidel yellow card fidel has a handful of hazard s shirt and he deliberately tugs him back to stop the run which earns him a yellow card der milit o yellow card militao was late as he came in on the back of boye and he kicks the forward s feet out from under him he s shown the first yellow card of the game no penalty after going over to the monitor to have a look at the replays the referee decides to overturn his original decision as there was barely any contact from gonzalez when hazard went down penalty to madrid for the second time in the game the referee points to the spot hazard tried to get away from gonzalez and the defender does have his hands on his back there doesn t look to be much in it though and the referee is going over to the monitor it s a great run from palacios as he skips away from two challenges in his own half before breaking through the middle it s switched out to guti on the left but he fouls modric before he can put a cross in madrid have started the second half on the front foot and they win a corner when mendy s clipped cross is blocked kroos low cross causes all sorts of problems in the six yard box but it s blocked by verdu ahead of vinicius at the far post madrid get us back underway for the second half elche managed the game well in the first half as they held strong during madrid s pressure before breaking on the counter to take the lead ramos will be hoping they can see this out in the second half madrid weren t short of chances though and if they can be more clinical in front of goal they look likely to get themselves back into this game boye s header gives elche a lead over madrid at half time madrid made a bright start to the game with vinicius benzema and casemiro all forcing good saves out of badia early on the hosts were then awarded a penalty when vinicius was fouled in the box but benzema skimmed the top of the crossbar from the spot minutes later boye scored a great header to put elche ahead with their first shot on target and kroos saw a free kick well saved just before the break half time real madrid elche great save madrid have one last chance to equalise in this half with a free kick to the left kroos steps up whipping his shot up and over the wall it s just dipping under the bar but badia gets across to push it away from the top corner save vazquez again has space on the right and he feeds the ball through to benzema he holds off gonzalez long enough to turn and hit a low shot on goal but it s straight at badia down the middle into four added minutes at the end of the first half and elche look a lot more comfortable in possession mojica makes another good run down the left linking up well with fidel until he s blocked off by militao chance casemiro s throughball cuts open elche s midfield and mendy has a clear run at goal he drills a low shot across goal and it s just wide of the far post he s claiming the keeper got a touch on that but the referee points for a goal kick fidel assist fidel got a yard on vazquez as he sprinted to get onto mojica s pass and he whips a brilliant cross into the space at the far post for boye l boy goal boye scores it s a lovely pass from mojica to play in fidel down the left and he whips a cross in from the byline boye throws himself forward to get on the end of it and his header flies past courtois and into the back of the net elche elche are starting to find their rhythm now and are keeping the ball well as they patiently play it out from the back madrid are trying to press them high upfield but can t get close at the moment elche win another corner but again it hits the first man at the near post casemiro flicks it away and verdu hooks a hopeful ball back into the middle perez is chasing it but courtois comes out to collect it milla has stayed down holding his ankle after that challenge on vinicius and the medical team are on to see to him he s back to his feet quickly though and he ll be able to carry on casemiro s pass deflects kindly into benzema s path and he does well to hold it up until vinicius gets up in support down the left the forward is fouled by milla though and wins a free kick k benzema penalty miss off the bar benzema takes a short run up to the spot and he s going for power when he strikes the ball badia is diving the wrong way but it doesn t matter as the ball skims the top of the crossbar still penalty to madrid milla loses the ball to kroos and vinicius spins to get into the box verdu misses him but palacios doesn t and clumsily pushes the forward to the ground the referee has a good view of it and points straight to the spot good save it s well worked out to vazquez on the right again only this time he pulls it back for modric on the edge of the box he drills his first time effort on goal and badia makes a good save with his feet to keep him out mendy runs into traffic down the left but turns back to kroos who switches it out to vazquez on the right his floated cross has the keeper scrambling back across his line but it ends up bouncing wide on the far side save madrid are really starting to up the pressure now and alaba plays a wonderful ball over the to benzema he brings it down with a brilliant first touch but his shot is straight down the middle at badia mendy has acres of space down the left and he squares a dangerous low cross onto the edge of the six yard box it s just behind benzema who improvises with the flick but gonzalez blocks it ahead of badia fidel tete morente morente is taken off the pitch on a stretcher with fidel on to replace him it looks like there s a problem here for morente who twisted his ankle after a collision with casemiro he s receiving treatment now but it doesn t look like he ll be able to carry on benzema touches it out to hazard on the right but he runs straight into a crowd when he cuts inside the rebound falls to vazquez who fizzes it into the box for hazard but he can only pull it back to modric he has a go from range but it s a comfortable save for badia gumbau s whipped corner bounces off vinicius but he gets it back from casemiro to break quickly on the counter he drives down the left before curling an early cross into the box but he can t pick out a team mate in the middle the ball bobbles up in madrid s box and boye reacts quickest to take it away from militao he tries to chip it back across goal to guti on the far side but mendy is in the right place to block it chance elche just can t get out of their own box at the moment and vinicius picks out kroos in space just outside the area he has time to take a touch before curling it towards goal but it s just wide of the near post madrid are on the attack again with modric threading it through to vazquez who made the overlapping run down the left he tries to square it to benzema at the far post but gonzalez steps in to intercept it save hazard quickly turns his defender to sweep the ball out to benzema on the left he touches it to vinicius who gets away from verdu with a drop of the shoulder and onto the edge of the six yard box he tries to tuck it into the near post but badia is there to hold it madrid are unbeaten in their last home laliga games w d since a defeat to levante in january madrid are keeping the ball well at the moment but they re struggling to find their way through a compact elche defence hazard cuts inside from the left but is crowded off it before he can get a cross in mojica and milla link up well down the left for the visitors but when the full back tries to loop a cross towards perez it s cleared by militao gumbau has a chance to put it back into the box but he can t find a way past casemiro boye brings the ball down with a lovely bit of control and elche have a chance to break now he switches it out to palacios down the right but his pass over the top to morente is overhit straight out of play benzema spins away from mojica down the left and plays a clever one two with vazquez near the byline to try and lose his defender the resulting cross into the box isn t so good though and verdu hooks it away boye gets the game underway for elche the teams are out on the pitch now with kick off just moments away madrid are unbeaten in their last laliga games against elche w d since a defeat away from home in

benefitted konstantelias who despite only turning in may already has three first team appearances at paok under his belt and having been around the senior squad for much of the campaign is expected to have a major breakthrough next season view this post on instagram a post shared by the teenager has come a long way from learning his trade on the streets of volos around kilometres from his current

paraskevi such a player does not emerge every day not even every years alexandros malakasiotis the head of agia pareskevi s academy told sportdog he has some gifts which are unique we had the pleasure of seeing konstantelias grow up here he left early but he stood out like a fly in milk for me he is a phenomenon if you see how he passes and moves into space you will understand what he is about when he goes one on on it is like watching neymar that neymar comparison is one konstantelias himself also makes saying he is my biggest influence in the modern game i feel more attracted to his playing style than anyone else s view this post on instagram a post shared by having joined paok in konstantelias made his way through the various age group teams at both club and international level catching the eye of a number of top european clubs along the way as he honed his skills in his favoured no position as well as barca both ajax and rangers are known to have scouted him extensively while chelsea believed they had secured konstantelias signature before he signed a new contract at paok in december that ties him to the greek outfit through to so confident were the blues of signing him that they were already setting up a loan pathway for konstantelias to spend time in either belgium or the netherlands before moving permanently to stamford bridge while atletico madrid are rumoured to have since entered the race for one of greek football s golden boys paok for what it is worth have shown to their academy talents that there is a path to the senior ranks following christos tzolis breakthrough season in the year old forward scored goals and laid on assists for the paok first team last season with his performances having earned him admiring glances from the likes of manchester united and borussia dortmund as well as a debut for the greece national side for me seeing christos come through shows the pathway for next season konstantelias says it is good that we are getting a chance to play and be part of the first team set up to show we have what it takes to conquer this step and then the next one we all want to take that chance we all grew up in the same setting and it has taken a lot of work to reach this stage the work has been very good in the academy over the years and it will show in the first team and what about konstantelias future view this post on instagram a post shared by i compartmentalise things and think about short term targets he insists it is not about where i am in five years but baby steps i want to be the best in my next game or training session i want to also enjoy what i am doing and keep loving what i am doing and enjoy playing in greece in general we watch a lot of the champions league and watch the top five leagues i feel closer to la liga as there s a lot more creativity and the league is more technical and free on the pitch that could be good news for barca if they were ever to reignite their interest in the teenager who

the club which first developed erling haaland for many fans they will always be the team with whom they associate the striker s first steps towards superstardom it was with salzburg that haaland first emerged into the consciousness of the wider footballing family with his run of goals in games at the start of the campaign catapulting him to global fame haaland of course has gone on to achieve

had been missing from sesko s game since he arrived at salzburg from his native slovenia in had been goals but after a run of games in the austrian second division through april and may that saw him net times in just six matches there is a feeling around the red bull arena that the year old is ready to step into haaland s shoes in such comparisons motivate me and give me energy sesko told reporters in his homeland when asked about being likened to haaland they do not represent pressure i will listen and learn so i can be even better than he is my team mates at the club tell me that haaland and i are very similar especially in terms of speed most of them even tell me that i m better than him that is quite some statement but sesko has certainly shown through his youth career that he has what it takes to go to the very top after beginning his football education in his hometown of radece he first appeared on the radar in slovenia when scoring goals in just games for second

time had we decided on the money benjamin would have moved to england or italy but we decided to look at the bigger picture and the salzburg project the biggest clubs in europe tried to get him the interest in him was huge i have never seen anything like it before view this post on instagram a post shared by benjamin s es ko salzburg has given benjamin a path here he can develop the people in charge really wanted him which was important to us here he also has a greater chance of playing for the first team sooner or later benjamin is one of the greatest talents of his age group in europe he has an incredible body is tall fast has great jumping ability is technically gifted and his greatest strength is his finishing that finishing ability was not quite on show during his first year in salzburg despite netting twice in a win over napoli in the uefa youth league playing alongside a host of other young talents for salzburg s sister club fc liefering in the austrian second tier he scored just once in appearances as he struggled to get to grips with playing against adults as a year old things though have gone differently for him over the course of the most recent campaign as he finished the season with goals and six assists across his appearances for liefering and though the majority of his goals came during that remarkable run towards the back end of the season his form earlier in the campaign did earn him a first team debut as an th minute substitute against hartberg in january only six players have made their senior bows for salzburg at a younger age since red bull s takeover in with that group including the likes of dayot upamecano and dominik szboboszlai meaning sesko is in good company despite that being his only appearance to date view this post on instagram a post shared by benjamin s es ko sesko has begun to make his mark at international level though and made history as the youngest player to ever represent slovenia when he made his debut against north macedonia the day after his th birthday in june that is likely to be the first of many caps particularly if those haaland comparisons come to fruition certainly sesko seems to possess a similar physical profile to the norway international while any questions over his eye for goal seem to have been answered in recent months the teenager has the pace to match too with his top speed having been clocked at km hour against fc dorrnbirn in april to put that in context that is almost identical to the speed kylian mbappe reaches when at full tilt where he perhaps differs from haaland though is his willingness to play with his back to goal and drop deeper so as to be more involved in build up play with his quick feet at times belying his stature i would say that benjamin is just benjamin sesko he is different many compare him to haaland but i think they are different types of players basanovic told zurnal they are similar in physical construction and speed but they are different players benjamin is more of a team player he is maybe better technically with his skills but haaland is a bit more wild with his energy in a positive sense view this post on instagram a post shared by benjamin s es ko he sesko remains a humble hard working boy i would not want to put any extra pressure on him he is still a young boy and there is still a lot ahead of him immediately ahead of sesko looks likely to be a permanent promotion to the salzburg first team with new manager matthias jaissle having coached the youngster during his time in charge of liefering and while it is unlikely that he will be able to make the same immediate impact as haaland there are hopes after his recent run that he can at least be a strong alternative off the bench for jaissle europe s top clubs will be watching too with sesko about to enter the final year of his contract and so while many believe haaland to be a once in a generation talent salzburg hope that is not the case mini haaland is ready to

finals all eyes will likely be on the vejle striker with a number of top clubs having already shown an interest in the latest new ibrahimovic faghir is a fast forward technically good has game intelligence and also participates in defensive work steen tychosen the head of vejle s academy said when faghir signed his first professional contract as a year old in wahid has many strengths and has tremendous confidence in his own abilities there is a bit of zlatan in him because he plays with great self confidence in training and in matches he doesn t play like he s only having grown up in one of the area s toughest neighbourhoods finlandsparken faghir joined the vejle academy as a six year old in before gradually making his way through the youth ranks he eventually made his first team debut in june after a campaign which saw him score seven goals and lay on nine assists in us matches faghir s impact was instant as he found the net in two of his first three senior outings before ending the campaign with five direct goal contributions in appearances as vejle secured promotion to the danish superliga check out football s best wonderkids with nxgn yeremy pino villarreal francisco conceicao porto mateusz musialowski liverpool in he has managed the step up to the top flight scoring six goals in league appearances through the end of season play offs though a hamstring injury limited his participation in the final weeks of the campaign when balancing his output with ibrahimovic at the same age he compares favourably too ibrahimovic s first two and a half professional seasons as a teenager at malmo saw him score goals in appearances though of those strikes came in the second tier of swedish football and he was by the time he reached that number of games faghir s first senior outings meanwhile have returned nine goals though he will not even turn until the end of july there are certainly similarities between the way the pair play too though faghir stands centimetres shorter than the ac milan star he too is able to show a physical side to his game while possessing excellent technique he also boasts a little arrogance and though at times he would be advised to cut out the odd flick or trick the teenager is certainly the kind of player who can get fans off their seats whenever he picks up the ball i think i am difficult to face on the pitch faghir told danish tabloid bt in february if people think i m annoying on the pitch and they don t like me it makes me even stronger unsurprisingly clubs from bigger and better leagues are already beginning to circle tottenham ac milan ajax and leicester city have all been credited with interest and they are unlikely to be faghir s only suitors view this post on instagram a post shared

players of that age and who play in that position his international future meanwhile could also come under some scrutiny despite having played all his age group games for denmark thus far the son of afghanistani parents the lions of khorosan have not given hope of convincing faghir to represent them in the future though for now he remains committed to the country of his birth without making any guarantees we hope and believe that wahid has a long career ahead of him in the national team with denmark because he is a very talented player explained flemming berg the head of elite development at the danish football association he has an important role in our youth national team and we see in him the potential for a long career in the national team that important role leads him to hungary and slovenia in the coming days and with a victory over much fancied france already in their back pocket denmark are quietly confident of going all the way in the u euros if they are to return on that

signed that the year old would spend the majority of the campaign playing with the b team but the decision facing conceicao sr regarding the fourth of his five sons francisco was always likely to be far more difficult francisco who is also known as chico has been highly touted since arriving at the porto academy in and was quickly christened messi do olival due to the similarities between his game and the argentine maestro and in reference to the club s training ground as such pressure was on the dragoes boss to blood chico through the first half of the campaign before he finally relented against boavista in february it could hardly have gone better view this post on instagram a post shared by francisco conceic a o conceicao introduced with minutes left and porto trailing within five minutes he had won the penalty from which sergio oliveira equalised six minutes later chico wriggled through the visitors defence before his low shot was parried into the path of evanilson to score what looked to be the winner the teenager turned instinctively towards his father who in turn had sped down the touchline to greet his son in an embrace that soon went viral around the world the only problem var saw fit to rule the goal out for offside the fairy tale ruined though chico s performance had certainly caught the eye any doubts over his ability were put to bed a week later when having come off the bench against maritimo he won yet another penalty in a minute cameo that earned him the man of the match award check out football s best wonderkids with nxgn mateusz musialowski liverpool cade cowell sj earthquakes andrija radulovic red star belgrade a star was born though he is a star who in part was made across the country in lisbon chico s formal footballing education began around the age of eight when his father returned to portugal after his first managerial role at standard liege in belgium at that point the youngest of the conceicao brothers chico was enrolled at belenenses only for it to quickly become clear that he was a special talent as such sporting c p moved quickly to sign him and he would spend his formative years learning and playing alongside the likes of nuno mendes eduardo quaresma and joelson fernandes who were all named to the nxgn list of the world s best teenage footballers view this post on instagram a post shared by francisco conceic a o conceicao mentally he has always been very strong joao plantier one of conceicao s first coaches at sporting told mais futebol he is not and has never been afraid of having the ball and taking a risk and it is not easy to maintain this courage throughout training because some coaches limit it fortunately francisco understands the game well and is not afraid to take a risk or give it to someone who is better placed when it is needed he has a natural balance easily changes his trajectory and is extremely aggressive in defending and attacking chico spent six seasons with sporting before in his father was hired as the new manager of porto as someone who came from a very tight knit family group the youngster took the decision to follow sergio to estadio do dragao sporting s loss was undoubtedly porto s gain and after a run of games in which he scored goals for the club s under s side in the diminuitive left footer who plays predominantly off the right hand side was beginning to turn heads francisco is similar to messi ex porto defender eduardo luis told record to compare him with someone well known it is with messi the kid has all the conditions to become a great player his father though was not so pleased to hear such comparisons being made this is bad he told a bola in january i think it is bad because it can take you to a different state of mind than what i think a or year old kid has to have he has to have fun football for him has to be played with pleasure with joy and obviously by following your dreams but in a realistic and calm way view this post on instagram a post shared by francisco conceic a o conceicao do not think that you have reached your maximum by doing two or three dribbles but then when you track back you drop off a little bit i emphasise that this attack to defence transition has to be stronger just as the offensive transition is fast to come back you have to be quick too it is clear that conceicao sr is not about to be accused of favouritism with chico also having been on a strict diet over the past year particularly when he found himself at home during the coronavirus enforced lockdown in spring that tough love certainly seems to have paid off with chico having finished the season with first team appearances including a champions league debut against juventus that saw him become porto s second youngest player in the competition s history the year old s performances earned him a call up to the portugal squad for march s u european championship group stages where he in turn became the team s youngest ever goalscorer at the competition after netting against switzerland he will back in action on monday when portugal take on italy in monday s quarter final with the knockout stages set to be played out over the course of seven days ahead of the senior european championship this summer conceicao s selection for that squad certainly cannot be linked to any kind of favouritism either what is now clear is that regardless of name messi do

pursuing him barcelona inter ac milan tottenham and benfica have all been credited with interest yet it is city who reportedly find themselves at the front of the queue for the attacking midfielder radulovic is one of the greatest prospects in europe his agent igor koijc told interlive it before the turn of the year with radulovic having enjoyed a meteoric rise since being invited to his first

against in a game that it is claimed first brought him to city s attention radulovic boasted of smashing the english in the aftermath with the diminutive left footer having thrived in a new no

is cristiano ronaldo he told kurir he achieved everything with work and effort i like his character thinking and lifestyle the man is a machine he is dedicated to work he gave everything for football

to train with the senior squad for the resumption of top level football following the coronavirus enforced shutdown with the league title secured he was brought on for his debut as a half time

at the marakana as a champion he told blic i am happy and proud because i have loved red star since i was a child and i have given my all to be a first team player i will not stop i am going to get even stronger to help me be better i believe that i will bring a lot of joy to the fans because i think i can do even more and while radulovic backed up his debut goal with an assist in his second appearance the season has not gone quite as he would have hoped view this post on instagram a post shared by andrija radulovic having begun the campaign on the bench he made nine appearances before the turn of the year only to be told on january that manager dejan stankovic wanted him to join red star s affiliate club graficar on loan in the second division with interest in him from red star s domestic rivals and clubs abroad radulovic refused instead insisting that he deserved more opportunities with the first team that though did not go down well with ex inter midfielder stankovic who in turn banished radulovic back to the youth ranks for the remainder of the campaign as it turned out the youngster may not have been available for much more of the season regardless having been out of action since april as he recovers from mononucleosis now all attention turns to his future and whether he has played his final game for the team he has supported all his life with his contract having just over a year left to run on it radulovic could be available for as little as m m m this summer should city or any of the other interested parties be willing to test the water and while there is

manchester united liverpool arsenal chelsea tottenham manchester city barcelona real madrid atletico madrid juventus inter and ac milan revealed their super league intentions in view of several media requests and as already stated several times fifa wishes to clarify that it stands firm in favour of solidarity in football and an equitable redistribution model which can help develop football as a sport particularly at global level since the development of global football is the primary mission of fifa in our view and in accordance with our statutes any football competition whether national regional or global should always reflect the core principles of solidarity inclusivity integrity and equitable financial redistribution moreover the governing bodies of football should employ all lawful sporting and diplomatic means to ensure this remains the case against this background fifa can only express its disapproval to a closed european breakaway league outside of the international football structures and not respecting the aforementioned principles fifa always stands for unity in world football and calls on all parties involved in heated discussions to engage in calm constructive and balanced dialogue for the good of the game and in the spirit of solidarity and fair play fifa will of course do whatever is necessary to contribute to a harmonised way forward in the

assessment of those involved he has vowed to ensure that any player taking part in the super league will be banned from representing their respective country while no places will be found for the associated teams in domestic or continental events ceferin has branded leading figures in the super league proposal as snakes and is still hoping to see ill advised blueprints ripped up as some serious backtracking takes place he has added at the uefa congress gentlemen you made a huge mistake some will say it is greed others distain arrogance there is still time to change your mind everyone makes mistakes football does not belong to anyone or rather it belongs to everyone because football is part of our heritage respect for history respect for tradition respect for others this means

group would automatically qualify for the quarter finals the fourth and fifth placed teams would then face each other in a play off match for the two remaining places in the quarter finals quarter finals and semi finals were to be played on a home and away basis with the final being played as a single leg fixture at neutral stadium the clubs who make up the permanent clubs however would be immune to elimination from the competition even if their performances were consistently poor how will a super league impact the premier league la liga and serie a the super league stated that its fixtures were to be played in mid week the slot traditionally saved for european fixtures as domestic games are played at the weekend the vision was that the super league would be played concurrently with the domestic competitions like the premier league as the champions league has been played but there were concerns that the top clubs will have virtually less motive to do well in their respective leagues due to the permanency of their participation in the super league the nature of the domestic leagues is to breed competition for a champions league spot but with the super league that would become irrelevant the founding clubs would be guaranteed in a manner yet to be defined the certainty of taking part in the richest and arguably most prestigious competition regardless of the results obtained on the field in their domestic leagues this concept was vociferously opposed by the other clubs in the english spanish and italian leagues what has the response to the super league been the super league has been heavily criticised by prominent football figures and supporters alike with gary neville leading the fans sentiment with his opposition to the tournament calling it pure greed and even suggesting that sides who have signed the proposals should be punished with a points deduction fans from the participating clubs led protests against the implementation of the super league accusing clubs of only caring about the financial rewards and not considering the fans chelsea fans will be protesting the super league plans in person at the stadium and pulling signs made by them from the stadium i ve seen liverpool supporters are doing the same cfc https t co befkkqlh nizaar kinsella april i m not against the modernisation of football competition but to bring forward proposals in the wake of covid is an absolute scandal united and the rest of the big six clubs that have signed up to it should be ashamed of themselves neville told sky sports it s been damned and rightly so i m a man utd fan and have been for years i m disgusted with manchester united and liverpool most liverpool they pretend you ll never walk alone the people s club the fans club man utd years born out of workers around here and they re breaking away into a league without competition that they can t be relegated from it s pure greed they re imposters they re nothing to do with football in this country there s years of history in this country from fans that have lived and loved these clubs and they need protecting deduct them all points tomorrow put them at the bottom of the league and take their money off them seriously you ve got to stamp on this it s criminal it s a criminal act against football fans in this country make no mistake about it this is the biggest sport in the world it s the biggest sport in this country and it s a criminal act as simple as that uefa also heavily opposed the tournament with president alexander ceferin vowing to punish super league participants and threatening to ban individual players from the world cup and euros we are all united against this nonsense of a project cynical plan completely against what football should be we cannot and will not allow that to change said ceferin players who will play in the teams that might play in the closed league will be banned from the world cup and euros we urge everyone to stand tall with us as we do everything in our power to ensure this never ends up in fruition participating clubs would also need the green light approval of the associations who govern the domestic competitions to allow them to join the breakaway tournament the premier league also condemned the plans with premier league chief executive richard masters stating in a memo to all clubs i cannot envisage any scenario where such permission would be granted could uefa really ban super league players from international tournaments an official uefa statement read we will consider all measures available to us at all levels both judicial and sporting in order to prevent this happening football is based on open competitions and sporting merit it cannot be any other way as previously announced by fifa and the six confederations the clubs concerned will be banned from playing in any other competition at domestic european or world level and their players could be denied the opportunity to represent their national teams super league president and real madrid chief florentino perez laughed off the suggestion that players could be banned however arguing that the law protected against such a punishment what is the lure of the super league participants of the super league would arguably be granted lucrative and significant financial rewards if they were allowed to play with the most superior clubs in the world on a more regular basis more so than the champions league through breaking off of their national competitions and forming a league where only the most elite players were to partake the super league could possibly compete with the nfl and nba and benefit from huge television rights deals what will happen to the champions league the super league would effectively doom the champions league as the uefa s premier club competition would without their biggest sides if the breakaway tournament ever formally began it could severely diminish the appeal and romance of the champions league which has always been the most prestigious european domestic club competition when asked if the champions league would still exist even without the big clubs however ceferin stated the answer is yes of course in europe there are many good clubs many devoted fans and we already approved the changes for european club competitions post we will do it with or without them contact us terms of service

laughable charles watts am est the gunners saw their request to cancel their latest premier league outing granted but the decision has sparked controversy the north london derby it s a day that arsenal and spurs fans wait all year for but they are going to have to wait a little longer for the second meeting of the season between the two sides after sunday s highly anticipated clash was called off after arsenal requested a postponement it s a request that was granted after a premier league board meeting on saturday with the official announcement coming around hours before the game was due to kick off editors picks from title glory to a m divorce inside conte s tumultuous chelsea tenure romain emperor psg transfer target faivre ready for the big time is rafael leao really the new henry ibrahimovic s little brother finally realising potential at ac milan it s not over yet southampton give hope to liverpool and chelsea by showing that man city are not invincible with arsenal having fewer than the required number of players available for the match outfield players and one goalkeeper the board accepted the club s application a statement from the premier league said the decision is a result of a combination of covid existing and recent injuries and players on international duty at the africa cup of nations all clubs are able to apply for a postponement if covid infections are a factor in their request it s a decision that has generated plenty of anger with fans pundits and members of the media all having their say and taking aim at arsenal abusing the rules former spurs midfielder jamie o hara fumed on social media sent players on loan a week ago then ask for games to get called off disgrace from the premier league meant to set the standard for every other league and it s a shambles abusing the rules sent players on loan a week ago then ask for games to get called off cos there confident enough in the squad they have disgrace from the premier league meant to set the standard for every other league and it s a shambles premierleague totars jamie ohara january o hara wasn t the only ex spurs player to be spitting feathers micky hazard blasted premier league how weak are you shocking decision forget about fans who have travelled at great expense from afar paid for flights and hotels because they chose to loan their players out i hope the fans get together and sue you for their losses you deserve nothing less clearly both o hara and hazard have a vested interest given their allegiances but plenty of others have joined in by painting arsenal as the villains in this story but it s not arsenal who should be being blamed for this increasingly messy situation it s the premier league they are the ones who set the rules so why are arsenal now being hammered for following them it s not like they have done it time and time again in fact this is the first time they have had a game called off during the pandemic at their own request when they have tried previously such as ahead of the brentford game on the opening weekend of the season they had their request rejected and were forced to play with a severely depleted squad who had had their preparations massively disrupted by a major covid outbreak at london colney arsenal are not a club who have ever tried to cheat the system as so many seem to be suggesting throughout the past few months they have done all they could to ensure games go ahead while clubs all around them have been requesting games to be called off left right and centre since december arsenal have had first team players suffering from covid as well as countless members of the coaching staff not once did they moan even when mikel arteta had to sit out the game against manchester city on new year s day due to a positive test but the fact is on this occasion they just didn t have enough players to go ahead with the game against spurs according to the rules set by the premier league were all the players missing due to covid no far from it of all the players who were absent only martin odegaard and an unnamed player who tested positive on saturday after the club s latest round of testing would have been missing because of the virus but that doesn t matter the rules are clear and are the same for everyone the fact is that until the premier league changes its stance when it comes to postponements this sort of thing is going to keep happening game off what started out as postponements due to a pandemic has now become about clubs not having their best team the premier league must stop this now draw a line in the sand and say all games go ahead unless you have an exceptional amount of cv cases it s wrong gary neville january what started out as postponements due to a pandemic has now become about clubs not having their best team gary neville tweeted after saturday s announcement the premier league must stop this now draw a line in the sand and say all games go ahead unless you have an exceptional amount of cv cases it s wrong neville is absolutely right it is time for the premier league to step in injuries and players being on international duty should not be a reason for matches being postponed clubs should only be allowed to make requests due to covid and nothing else there s no doubt that arsenal have used the current system to their advantage but they are not the villains here just as liverpool weren t when they clearly did the exact same thing to get the first leg of their league cup semi final against arsenal called off less than a fortnight ago did arsenal complain then no did they issue any statement on their website at the time when their plans were thrown into disarray at the last minute no just as they didn t when a hugely injury hit wolves had their game at the emirates called off just after christmas they just accepted it and got on with it because the rules are there in black and white should they be changed absolutely hopefully this could be the situation that leads to that change but for now the likes of o hara and hazard really need to look elsewhere when it comes to pointing the finger of blame and let s not pretend their anger is anything to do with protecting the league s integrity it s down to the fact they have just missed the chance to see spurs take on an arsenal side with half a squad missing it s self interest nothing else all ok for liverpool on thursday jamie carragher sarcastically tweeted when arsenal confirmed that sunday s game would no longer go ahead clearly carragher whose paymasters at sky were most likely fuming at having their big game of the weekend called off at the last minute had forgotten why arsenal are having to play this coming thursday night in the first place it is of course because liverpool with so many players out through injury and away at afcon conveniently managed to beat lottery type odds to uncover a big batch of false positive covid cases leading to the first leg of the carabao cup semi final being rearranged it was switched to anfield last week a game that saw arsenal pick up injuries to cedric soares calum chambers bukayo saka and kieran tierney had that not happened they would have been fine to take on spurs on sunday so it s all well and good to have ex players and pundits lining up to take potshots at arsenal but let s not pretend they have acted any differently to anyone else this isn t an arsenal problem it s a premier league problem and until they change the rules that everyone can follow this is going to keep happening contact us terms of

are there for all to see it was a low key conversation in a liverpool coffee shop which ended up changing tony clarke s life i suppose you could say i became an overnight success he tells goal smiling but it took me years to get there clarke nicknamed madness on account of his apparent childhood resemblence to the s ska band is a coach at the famous liverpool harriers running club which has produced the likes of steve smith anyika onuoura and katarina johnson thompson among others editors picks from title glory to a m divorce inside conte s tumultuous chelsea tenure romain emperor psg transfer target faivre ready for the big time is rafael leao really the new henry ibrahimovic s little brother finally realising potential at ac milan it s not over yet southampton give hope to liverpool and chelsea by showing that man city are not invincible a talented long distance runner himself he combined the role with his day jobs organising dance events while running a vending machine business at the harriers he worked with high class athletes olympians and paralympians as well as coming across various footballers rugby players and boxers out on the track then in late came a chat with owen brown brown is the representative of manchester star phil foden he and clarke go way back and meet regularly at antonio s in liverpool s metquarter jamie carragher will often join them as will liam smith the former world light middleweight boxing champion or bradley orr the former blackburn and qpr defender we put the world to rights laughs clarke they should have a camera on us it d be tv gold view this post on instagram anyway on this particular occasion brown began talking about foden and his dribbling prowess only for clarke to interrupt i told him he could be so much quicker you know clarke says i explained why and that was that i thought no more of it we carried on with our day anyway a few days later the phone rings unknown number hiya it s phil foden i was like alright mate whatever but then he mentions owen so i know it s him we ended up chatting on the phone i explained what i meant that i felt he could be quicker off the mark and he said ok can i come down and see you foden and clarke met on a cold evening at wavertree athletics centre where clarke sought to correct the imperfections he had spotted it was his first three steps he explains his stride was too long he needed to shorten it so that his foot landed underneath his body underneath his hips if you overstride you land on your heel so essentially your foot stays on the floor for too long i felt if he could change from a heel striker into a front of the foot striker it d add so much and so over the course of eight sessions they got to work we started with some really simple exercises he says ladders footwork drills working on his stride the first thing you notice with phil is that he wants to learn i ll be honest i thought he might show up for one or two sessions and that d be it but he understood what i was saying what i wanted him to do after a couple of sessions i started showing him videos of nfl players short distances accelerations change of direction i told him imagine a clock face you re at a standing start and i want you to go to one two three o clock and so on what do you need to do you watch the nfl players and it s the feet they move first pointing in the direction they want to go then the arms start pumping and off they go phil if he wanted to change direction he d sidestep first and then turn his body but if you do that you re not using your quads hamstrings glutes you re not generating any power or momentum so we did a load of hexagon drills he d be in the middle rattling his feet and i d shout two o clock nine o clock six o clock and off he d go we worked on that change of direction with his foot then pumping the arms so that the legs would follow lockdown of course would disrupt their progress but foden remained keen to continue the improvement he had seen from those initial sessions he asked me to come up to his house and do some work with him in the back garden clarke says and when i say back garden it s more like a football pitch we d do some more speed and agility work he has a goal up and we d have a bit of a mess around there i ve got some videos of him on my phone whipping free kicks into the top corner landing balls in this trampoline net from yards ridiculous by the time city returned to training post lockdown foden could feel the difference he said in one of the first sessions back pep guardiola commented on his sharpness off the mark clarke grins so he told him he d been working with a sprint coach explained what we d been doing and pep said keep doing it the first game back he came off the bench and scored against arsenal then in the second he scored two and was man of the match against burnley he rang me five minutes after the end and was like oh my god mate i felt like a rocket out there he could see the improvement and i think everyone can now he is lightning off the mark now and he can sustain it for minutes too for clarke those few months proved transformative it was foden among others who encouraged him to go full time with his coaching he helped set up an instagram account and the endorsement of one of the premier league s biggest stars meant more clients would follow view this post on instagram clarke now works with a host of footballers from youth team players such as manchester united s charlie mcneill manchester city s lewis fiorini and wigan s james carragher son of jamie to liverpool womens star missy bo kearns and established mens professionals such as lee peltier middlesbrough and jon flanagan hb koge snooker legend ronnie o sullivan drops in occasionally too conor coady the wolves and england defender is another client i ve known him since he was at the academy at liverpool clarke says i went down to kirkby to observe him for days a long time ago and his flaws were obvious he landed flat footed and when he ran he looked like he had his hands in his pockets there was no angle to his running stride so he was not generating enough momentum we did loads of work on that ladders and drills to reduce contact time and get him pushing through quicker driving the arms i kept in touch with him right through sending him drills and ideas then in the summer just after the euros we got together for a few sessions we did the hexagon drill i d done with phil working on his foot positioning he said afterwards f cking hell mate for two years nuno espirito santo has been telling me there s something not quite right about your feet and now it all makes sense i sent him a hexagon to his house and told him to use it once or twice a week i told him just move your feet different directions consistency repetition he sends me messages now that he s been working on it that s conor the ultra professional view this post on instagram it s clear from an hour in clarke s company that he loves his work he speaks with passion and has a story for every occasion he studies other sports particularly nfl religiously and keeps a record of the fastest players in the premier league foden he says is desperate to reach no on the list but competition from known speedsters such as sadio mane adama traore kyle walker or allain saint maximin or from surprise inclusions such as leicester s caglar soyuncu who topped the list is fierce it s changed the way i watch games he laughs i m a liverpool fan and i look at someone like trent alexander arnold and think he can be quicker he s another over strider i m a bit worried about ibrahima konate too if a forward gets close to him and takes off he s done for people think if you re tall you naturally don t have acceleration but who s the fastest person ever usain bolt how tall is he ft in i d love to work with trent on shortening his stride i d have him running up little steep hills yards the same with konate same with the young lad rhys williams they re unbelievable athletes but they can be quicker it s good to be quick once you get into your stride but in the premier league it might be too late by then he adds it s speed endurance doing it for minutes you look at what players do now in a game they can run up to km they re doing sprints and they re doing thousands of accelerations and decelerations so if you re improving speed endurance improving acceleration and deceleration by even half a per cent it s huge that s what phil was able to do and the benefits are there for everyone to see contact us terms of

cards romain faivre is certainly not a young man lacking in confidence he has been in the news for two primary reasons in january firstly an impudent panenka against a covid stricken bordeaux side in the coupe de france infuriated brest s ligue rivals who felt that he was purposely humiliating them days later rumours over a potential move to paris saint germain began to circulate editors picks

southampton give hope to liverpool and chelsea by showing that man city are not invincible rashford revives man utd s top four challenge as rangnick s gamble pays off against west ham the brest midfielder has spent the last months entertaining ligue fans with his graceful brand of football impressing at a club that traditionally does not earn much media coverage or garner much interest he has brought both but while psg are set to have a restrained transfer window the former monaco youth player appears on the shortlist of the parc des princes side this january speaking to canal he has made it clear he would be open to a move to play for psg there s been contact with my agent he explained a week ago it s a dream it s my city my family and my friends are there previously he had been heavily courted by serie a club milan only for the deal to break down as the italians offer of million m m was deemed insufficient view this post on instagram certainly with his easy technique and graceful style he would have been a fitting addition to the rossoneri ranks and he made it clear to brest that he was not happy at being unable to leave for san siro indeed he was even exiled from the squad on one occasion as a result of his outspoken nature which player in the brest squad would not be flattered by ac milan s interest he told ouest france i had contact with them but i m not obsessed i made it clear that in football i have high goals and ambitions if faivre is assured in his own ability he has been wise enough to build a team around him that will allow him to thrive he has his own physical trainer a mental trainer a nutritionist almost like one would expect from an individual athlete i m just preparing to be above the others i pay attention to my physique my diet my sleep i m putting all these little details together to help me get to a team like ac milan he said he left monaco at the age of having played just four first team games and there was little widespread expectation on him when he arrived at brest in the summer of his background work though clearly did the trick he hit the ground running scoring four goals and creating three more before christmas and even if he faded a little in the second half of the campaign he had shown enough to persuade milan to make an approach his influence has only grown this season albeit it has been dulled by playing in a side that has struggled to excel nevertheless with seven goals and five assists he has already beaten his scoring tally from last season and lies just one short in the other statistic perhaps what has been most impressive about the left sided player is that he has been equally effective in a number of different roles over the past months an ability to play left centre or right midfield in an attacking style offers versatility while his dribbling qualities mean he has the capacity to open up tightly packed defences given that he is no slouch defensively there is a lot to like about his game he will not be easy to capture with a contract that runs until all the power lies with brest and they have indicated they do not want to sell we re calm sporting director gregory lorenzi told l equipe at the end of december we want to keep romain until the end of the season and we don t want him to leave this winter but if there s an offer we can t refuse we ll study it our first thought is that he ll stay and we ll reanalyse his situation next summer a move to psg would doubtless be a big step up but faivre has shown he has it in his locker to prove his doubters wrong while he has the focus and professional attitude that could take him far in the game he could prove a fine addition to the parc des princes club which has been leaning on kylian mbappe far too heavily for too long

rangnick s gamble pays off against west ham it was a shame that the coach s time in west london had ended in such acrimony and surprising too given it had started so promisingly indeed in his first year in charge conte transformed a side that had finished th the season before into premier league champions a switch to a formation which hadn t often been seen in england sparked a game winning run that led to his side romping to the title the blues went close to pulling off a domestic double in but they were beaten in the fa cup final by arsenal however they would return to wembley the following year to lift the trophy following a victory over manchester united two major trophies in two seasons would normally guarantee at least another year at the helm for a manager but conte s tenure had already began to unravel before the end of the campaign the first signs of tension at stamford bridge actually appeared during the january transfer window after diego costa pushed for a m m move to chinese super league club tianjin quanjian the blues forced the brazil born spain international to stay put and he played a key role in their subsequent title triumph however conte then informed costa that he was not part of his future plans via text message while the striker was on holiday costa was furious and partook in several interviews where he claimed he had been treated like a dog inside the club many blamed conte for his insensitive handling of the situation and believed he should have let club director marina granovskaia deal with costa s exit nonetheless after their title success which secured a return to the champions league chelsea sought to strengthen a squad that conte did not believe was sufficiently equipped to challenge for trophies in both england and europe the blues brought in several players but not necessarily all of those on conte s ambitious wishlist having already been left disappointed by seeing top target virgil van dijk leave southampton for liverpool for a then record fee for a defender m m conte was further frustrated by missing out on leonardo bonucci who left juventus for ac milan in the summer of conte was also keen on alex oxlade chamberlain romelu lukaku and kyle walker while the blues also had an significant bid turned down for ac milan s alessio romagnoli and even approached bayern munich s robert lewandowski during the lecce native s time at the club however for the campaign chelsea had instead brought in alvaro morata tiemoue bakayoko danny drinkwater and davide zappacosta in what many believe to be the club s most disastrous transfer window in recent times unsurprisingly chelsea were quickly left behind by manchester city in the title race and in november influential technical director michael emenalo left the club by mutual consent which was hugely significant as it meant that the mediator between conte and granovskaia was removed from the equation what followed almost inevitably was a series of bitter and depressing press conferences in which conte publicly expressed his unhappiness with chelsea s transfer business chelsea are still counting the cost of the campaign to this day as the january arrivals of olivier giroud emerson palmieri and ross barkley took their overall outlay that season to m m the blues did still lift the fa cup but they finished fifth in the premier league which saw them fall back out of the champions league it quickly became clear during the summer that followed that chlesea wanted to bring in maurizio sarri as their new manager but his arrival was held up by napoli s ultimately successful attempt to make the m m signing of jorginho part of the deal as it was though conte was actually forced to take the first three training sessions of the new season as he awaited his fate he arguably deserved better but looking back at the whole affair it would be unfair to portray either side as a hero or villain it was just another dramatic episode in the turbulent world of chelsea who have forked out around m m in severance pay to sacked managers since roman abramovich bought the club in conte for his part has always been reluctant to shed much light on his chelsea tenure i spent two seasons where i created a good relationship with players staff people who work at chelsea the now tottenham coach said ahead of the first of three meetings with his former

cup on february tottenham are in action on the same day against brighton and hove albion on home soil chelsea end a run of four matches without a win in the premier league after defeating tottenham at stamford bridge the home side took the lead in the early stages of the second half through a stunner from hakim ziyech before thiago silva added a second with a glancing header from mason mount s free kick spurs will feel aggrieved after harry kane saw a first half strike controversially ruled out for a foul on thiago silva however antonio conte s men were lacklustre in the second period and as a

the oldest player to score in the premier league since february when year old ryan giggs netted against queens park rangers for manchester united mount bursts into the right inside channel and tries to fire at goal from a tight angle but lloris gets out to make a block with his body chelsea are attempting to control the game to work their way towards the three points game management is required from the blues especially after spurs antics during the week n kant jorginho jorginho is withdrawn after a quiet performance kante replaces the italy international in the middle of the park hojbjerg almost threads the needle to release doherty in the right inside channel but the throughball just evades the wing back on the charge sarr makes a vital block at the back to stop a strike from doherty after he was teed up by skipp in the right inside channel save lukaku rolls past a challenge from sanchez on the edge of the tottenham box and rifles a strike at goal from the left inside channel but lloris beats his effort away lloris commits himself at the back to attempt to clear a cross field pass from azpilicueta away from hudson odoi and he just does enough although doherty is required to mop up the danger ziyech attempts a speculative on his right foot rather than his left but he floats a tame strike into the hands of lloris ziyech whips a dangerous cross into the box from the right flank that lukaku tries to attack but kane is there to divert it over his own bar ziyech runs at davies down the right flank and wins a free kick as he draws a foul chelsea have another chance to send

right corner dier brings down hudson odoi on the left flank which bemuses the tottenham players mount swings a perfect cross into the box for thiago silva to attack and he gets between two white shirts to direct his effort into the back of the net over mount and hudson odoi combine in the final third which sees the former launch a powerful left footed strike that creeps just over the bar chelsea have the lead and are looking comfortable on the ball spurs have to hold out amid the pressure at the start of the second half lloris denies ziyech the winger almost has a second but sees his effort saved by a fine stop from lloris ziyech plays azpillicueta down the right flank and he cuts a ball back to mount he shoots on the turn only to be denied by sanchez s block ziyech gathers the

effort into the back of the net a super strike we re back under way at stamford bridge after a brief delay so one of the goal nets could be repaired chelsea are enduring the same struggles as their last four premier league matches in front of goal lukaku looks devoid of confidence in the final third missing two decent openings the blues need the belgian or someone else to step up to capitalise on the chances that are being created it s goalless at the break in the premier league clash between chelsea and tottenham at stamford bridge chelsea had a host of chances in the early stages but were unable to get the breakthrough as romelu lukaku and callum hudson odoi failed to hit the target spurs will feel that they should be ahead after harry kane converted from close range only for his effort to be controversially disallowed for a foul on thiago silva half time chelsea tottenham sessegnon hands chelsea a free kick in a useful position on the right flank after bringing down azpilicueta ziyech takes the free kick but floats his delivery straight into the hands of lloris there will be three minutes of added time over chelsea win two corners in succession and mount sends the second in from the right flank thiago silva rises highest but he sends his effort just over the bar block lukaku latches on to a throughball in space down the left flank he breaks into the box and lines up a drive that dier diverts behind chelsea are incredulous as tanganga survives pulling the shirt of hudson odoi before hojbjerg gets the decision from the referee after being fouled by kovacic jorginho yellow card jorginho fouled bergwijn in the build up to kane s disallowed goal and is booked after the fact disallowed goal kane slots the ball home with composure after latching on to a cutback from sessegnon however his celebrations are short lived as the referee blows for a nudge on thiago silva in the box the contact from kane was minimal but the referee and var agree that it was enough to knock the defender off balance wide rudiger wins the ball at the back and continues his run up the field he combines with ziyech and bursts down the right flank rudiger sends a cross into the box that lukaku steers behind under pressure from sanchez chance hojbjerg releases sessegnon down the left flank and he surges into the box only to drag the ball harmlessly wide of the post j tanganga yellow card tanganga brings down hudson odoi on the charge and goes into the book wide lukaku works the ball to hudson odoi in the final third who cuts inside to fire at goal on his right foot it bends away from goal after lukaku in the middle opts to leave it on its trajectory miss chelsea play around the tottenham press and mount coasts into space down the right flank he exchanges passes with ziyech before sending a cutback towards lukaku but the forward misses his kick at goal thiago silva has to be careful as he catches bergwijn from behind in the middle of the park the contact was slight but the brazilian will be treading lightly now kane tries to slide a throughball forward for the run of bergwijn but it evades the dutchman and travels through to kepa mount makes another probing run down the right flank that hojbjerg eventually halts with a fine sliding tackle the england man has had space on the flank thiago silva yellow card thiago silva blocks off the run of bergwijn racing upfield and goes into the book spurs clear their lines from two crosses into the box from ziyech before mount sends tanganga crashing into the advertising hoardings with a nudge fortunately the defender is okay mount surges into the right inside channel and clips a cross to the back post that tanganga has to head behind at the back post sarr goes down after being late on the ankle by doherty which is not punished on the field var has a look at the incident but deems that the referee made the correct call bergwijn breaks on the counter for the visitors and coasts past two chelsea players before being halted by a good sliding challenge from kovacic stop winks charges through the middle of the chelsea midfield and reaches the edge of the box before firing at goal he gets plenty of pace behind his strike but kepa gets down to make a solid stop save ziyech twists and turns on the edge of the tottenham box and he sends a curling strike towards goal it seems a tame effort but lloris opts to punch it away rather than claim the ball dier makes a positive charge forward to the edge of the chelsea box the blues get men back to surround the spurs defender before he fouls thiago silva attempting to regain possession over mount swings the resulting corner into the tottenham box for thiago silva to attack but he plants his header over the bar ziyech collects in space on the edge of the spurs box and tries to release mount down the right flank but sessegnon gets back to sweep the ball behind chelsea probe in the final third and jorginho offloads to ziyech in space he lines up a drive on his left foot that is diverted behind for a corner by davies wide ziyech angles a cross to the back post for the run of hudson odoi in the left inside channel but the winger heads his effort narrowly wide of the left post chance lukaku latches on to a precise cutback from mount from the right flank and has space to fire at goal in the box however the forward scuffs his right footed effort over the bar a huge chance spurned we re under way at stamford bridge tottenham have won just one of their last away league games against chelsea d l winning in april with current boss

live scores milan is rafael leao really the new henry ibrahimovic s little brother finally realising potential at ac milan mark doyle gmt the best player in the history of sporting s academy has long been viewed as frustrating as he is talented but he is now delivering consistently there have never been any doubts over rafael leao s talent former sporting youth team coach tiago fernandes has always maintained that the almada native is the best player in the history of the academy better than paulo futre better than luis figo and yes even better than cristiano ronaldo at the same age editors picks from title glory to a m divorce inside conte s tumultuous chelsea tenure romain emperor psg transfer target faivre ready for the big time it s not over yet southampton give hope to liverpool and chelsea by showing that man city are not invincible rashford revives man utd s top four challenge as rangnick s gamble pays off against west ham the big problem as far as fernandes was concerned was leao s complacency the feeling that pure talent alone would prove sufficient to propel him to the summit of the game it was strange too given leao idolised ronaldo a living legend renowned for his incredible work ethic cristiano is the best in the world the prodigiously gifted attacker told goal in he has made a successful career with a lot of hard work and is a great example to follow only leao didn t he quickly became as famous for his potential as his lethargy even during his solitary season at lille in then club president gerard lopez labelled leao the portuguese mbappe but coach christophe galtier admitted he s a player who can make you pull your hair out but a few minutes later bring you a lot of hope and a smile ac milan certainly felt leao was a risk worth taking and paid million m m for his services in august he scored six times during his debut season in serie a showing numerous flashes of his awesome ability however leao was still frustrating fans coaches and team mates club sources revealed that he sometimes cut a distracted almost disinterested figure in training when zlatan ibrahimovic rejoined milan in january he immediately took his fellow forward under his wing even leao soon began referring to the swedish striking icon as his big brother since he arrived he s been talking to me giving me advice on how to improve how to position myself in the penalty area the portuguese explained he s a great player and i want to learn as much as i can with him by my side ibrahimovic though felt that too much of what he was telling leao was going in one ear and out the other no matter what he said he couldn t quite seem to get through to leao to make him realise just what was expected of a top professional then during the summer leao totally changed as ibrahimovic put it he understood himself what to do the swede told corriere tv for leao the penny had dropped he couldn t get by just turning it on for minutes here and there he accepted what ibrahimovic milan coach stefano pioli his parents and his personal trainer were all telling him he needed to be on it each and every week for minutes god has given me the talent which is rare but i must add sacrifices and hard work he admitted in an interview with la repubblica in november i have a talent to cultivate but you don t play alone in football and i ve proved that i can make it at milan he s most certainly done that over the past few months rafael leao comes up big for ac milan pic twitter com vugvcamdv goal january just over halfway through the campaign leao has as many goals in all competitions eight as he s ever previously managed as a professional over the course of an entire season in addition he s also contributed four assists has completed more dribbles than any other player based in serie a and is now set to be rewarded with a bumper new contract the upturn in form has also resulted in the mbappe comparisons resurfacing but stefano pioli feels leao is more similar to another famous french forward he reminds me a lot of thierry henry the milan coach told reporters earlier this month given pioli is hardly a man renowned for making outlandish statements the comparison provoked plenty of debate in italy however it has been backed up by the likes of nicola amoruso and alessio tacchinardi both of whom were on juventus books when henry spent six months in turin in the young henry is the leao of today tacchinardi told tuttosport the characteristics of the two players are the same you see the pace in one on ones and they always go on the outside to break through the opponent s defence i was slaughtered on social media for this comparison but just compare the videos and there s nothing else to say they re the same amoruso is in total agreement but he added in an interview with the gazzetta dello sport leao just has to better understand how strong he is once he does this nobody will stop him and this leads us on to the great contradiction in leao s character for all of his faith in his natural talent he still doesn t seem to have fully grasped just how far he can go italian coaching icon fabio capello and pioli have also said the same thing leao doesn t yet realise the enormity of his potential still it s clear from both recent statements and recent performances that the player himself has at least started to see the merits of adding industry to innovation i think he has to convince himself and work a lot on his mentality to try to become even more ambitious added pioli whom leao views as a reference point in his career one with his means must think of getting to the top of the world but talent is not enough he understands that he has to work in a certain way and work with others encouragingly leao now forms one of the most formidable left flanks in europe alongside theo hernandez with the pair combining to devastating effect to torment opposition right backs indeed how juventus cope with milan s dual threat out wide will go a long way towards determining the outcome of sunday s massive serie a showdown at san siro leao is clearly not the finished article he cannot be compared to the henry that arsene wenger transformed into arguably the finest attacking talent the premier league has ever seen still there are undeniable similarities to the henry that toiled in turin for six months there is the sensational speed the devastating dribbling skills and the valuable versatility of course a key difference is that while leao is flourishing out wide under pioli henry floundered under ancelotti however as tacchinardi pointed out the portugal international is another diamond in the rough one that could yet be polished into something quite spectacular and the signs are that after a couple of seasons of frustration which required an immense amount of patience from pioli co milan are finally well placed to succeed with leao where juve failed with henry contact us terms of service privacy policy

met him when he was and few people understood his way of playing tiago fernandes now a coach at chaves but a man who was leao s mentor told france football he was doing things with the ball that no one could do but he still forgot his positioning on the field branded the best player in the history of the sporting academy by fernandes above even cristiano ronaldo he debuted for the first team as an year old nutmegged the great iker casillas as he scored against porto but left in the aftermath of coach jorge jesus s fall out with president bruno de carvalho he s the portuguese mbappe lille president gerard lopez told rmc as he celebrated beating off the likes over dortmund and benfica for the player s signature lopez though was also forced to bat off claims from sporting that they were owed the million m m value of the player s release clause a fight that lille subsequently won the player meanwhile has been doing his best to shrug off comparisons to the paris saint germain wonderkid

today i m with lille to do that and to progress he said in december but like the french superstar the player s father antonio has had a big influence in his career indeed had the teenager had things

noticias the agent has a red card and cannot set foot back here we were ready to negotiate with big clubs and now he s stuck in lille when he could have gone to real madrid antonio was so keen on a move to lille though because of the way they have nurtured youngsters in the past like eden hazard and more recently pepe and bamba head coach christophe galtier meanwhile is anxious that he earned his right to play and did not start purely because of his up and coming reputation he was starting to lose his patience to get upset in training because there were matches he could have come on in but circumstances didn t allow it the coach accepted after handing him his first start in which he scored against caen he s a player who can make you pull your hair out but a few minutes later bring you a lot of hope and a smile now however his flurry of goals have cemented him as lille s no for the foreseeable future i m very happy he admitted after bagging another against amiens last weekend it s important for me it gives me extra motivation to continue working and to give the best of myself as galtier concedes leao is far from the finished product with the coach eager to see him more efficient defensively and that sense of positioning that fernandes joked about still with room for improvement yet the raw materials for excellence are prevalent like his lille cohorts he is fast and technical able to play wide if required yet his strength in the air is greater than that of losc s other starters for a young player to have so much maturity in front of goal is impressive while his understanding of lille s gameplan is growing he s progressing and working a lot galtier said relationships with other players are being struck up he s present and effective in the box i believe he s

lopez and angers both face the possibility of administrative relegation because of their financial issues both are expected to prove their financial health and avoid this penalty but this has

years and who has only ever been in charge of guingamp and bordeaux has been tasked with leading their title defence it is seen as the sign of a club foundering marseille meanwhile have been steadily strengthening with an impressive calibre of player this is despite losses confirmed at m m m for the season sporting director pablo longoria s ambitious plans to support head coach jorge sampaoli have won acclaim from the om support but equally they have been subject to scrutiny from the dngc ligue s financial watchdog which has warned the club about overspending both in terms of transfers and in wages i m happy with the types of measures that are used by the dncg longoria a former newcastle scout who has worked with clubs such as juventus and valencia in the past said at guendouzi s presentation on wednesday there must be limits to the way teams are constructed in france crucially longoria also stressed that marseille s flexibility in the market has come about thanks to the number of players they have seen depart florian thauvin is the highest profile of these with the former newcastle winger leaving for tigres in mexico meanwhile valere germain was on a lofty salary after moving from monaco where he was a member of the side that won ligue in while the big earning kevin strootman has been shunted out on loan to cagliari we can continue to recruit because we didn t have many players under contract this is what has allowed us to continue our signing policy the executive continued confirming that spain goalkeeper pau lopez should arrive imminently from roma

back duje caleta car and france under star boubacar kamara are both expected to leave this summer for sizeable fees we re waiting on the situation in the transfer market but om will not sell players below their market value longoria said of course there may be an element of speculation in these moves marseille gained sufficient momentum under sampaoli towards the end of last term to suggest that they can afford some confidence for the upcoming season while much of ligue crumbles around them marseille are attempting to buck the trend by building solid foundations that could make them champions

invincible it was a curt summary of emery s troubles in recent years but this season the coach has locked the skeletons up in the closet double locked the doors and is focusing on europa league glory again villarreal face manchester united in the europa league final on wednesday and the coach can win the competition for a record fourth time it wasn t always the plan though after a remarkable hat trick of triumphs with sevilla in and emery set his sights on something more he replaced laurent blanc at paris saint germain the spaniard s first season in paris was a disaster with monaco pipping his team to ligue ending a four year streak of psg wins worse still after a win over barcelona in the champions league last his team threw it away at camp nou barcelona s remontada went down in history as one of the most shocking and incredible nights ever in the competition psg surprisingly gave him another chance and although he won ligue at the second attempt another champions league ko this time at the hands of real madrid meant he had to be removed the coach landed at arsenal in may replacing club legend arsene wenger the gunners had finally lost patience with the french coach after the club lost their grip on the top four and began to play europa league football unfortunately for emery he could not inspire them to anything more they finished fifth and were thrashed by chelsea in the europa league final unable to secure champions league qualification via that route emery spent big in the summer breaking a club transfer record with the million m signing of nicolas pepe from lille a player who is still yet to shine in the premier league results did not follow and the coach lost respect from his charges some even mocking his accent behind his back with the fans and media also against him arsenal went on the club s longest winless run since and emery was sacked in november he stewed on it for a few months before returning to his native spain to start afresh with villarreal at the start of the season emery had enjoyed a successful spell in his early years on spain s east coast with valencia so it was a real homecoming when he was back in his comfort zone it quickly began to pay dividends back working in his native language able to interact with players fully and deliver his detailed tactical instructions emery was confident again crucially he was also respected in spain the mockery that he suffered in england held no water with his sevilla and valencia body of work considered far more relevant when assessing his reputation even the remontada was only referred to when he was back at camp nou that s where the season began and his team were given a thrashing emery apologised to supporters for the team s performance but they quickly found their feet villarreal went games unbeaten after that breaking a club record using both the good and bad experiences under his belt from his time abroad emery has chiselled villarreal into a tough respectable side he was flexible enough in his thinking to shift from a pre season set up with more creativity to a sterner more combative midfield away from paris and london in the small castellon city there are no distractions and no superstar figures like neymar or kylian mbappe to manage that villarreal s outstanding talent gerard moreno is a media shy hard worker is undoubtedly a boon for the coach it sets the tone not only for the dressing room but emery s tactical set up too the club loaned real madrid youngster takefusa kubo but his spark was too raw for emery and he let the japanese forward go cutting the loan short without many world class stars the coach could play how he liked and has although the yellow submarine are not an exciting side under emery they are a tough one to face that s how they went so many games unbeaten even if they drew more of them than they would have liked regardless of whether his team oust manchester united to win the europa league in gdansk emery will consider his season a success his reputation rehabilitated perhaps the finest moment of it came when beating arsenal in the semi finals ending their hopes of appearing in europe next season too and getting one over his compatriot and emirates successor mikel arteta good ebening gunners tweeted mesut ozil ahead of the semi final second leg it s part of the zeitgeist at this point recalling the bad atmosphere the coach left behind in london but emery left with a aggregate victory and a place in the final against ole gunnar solskjaer s manchester united next season will be the first in campaigns that arsenal will not have played european football while the gunners sink emery has set his sights on silverware and a champions league spot come the autumn villarreal controlled the tactics emery i thought was too smart for arteta admitted arsenal legend martin keown on bt sport the europa league is after all emery s territory this is his fifth europa league final but it is villarreal s first he has taken them to the next level something they have been yearning for i am lucky enough to have coached over there although it ended in unwanted circumstances said emery

lacazette goal goal arsenal make it lacazette adds his second of the game and makes it on aggregate a lovely quick counter by arsenal with saka finding pepe down the right wing he squares it to lacazette in the box who has time and space to control it and then fire it into the back of the net with kolar having no chance of saving it dinamo zagreb have pulled a goal back in spain against villarreal but it is the spanish side who still lead on aggregate the pace of the game is quite slow with neither team pushing forward in search of a goal arsenal look set to wrap up a comfortable victory after a busy first half s tecl j kuchta the hosts have made another change with kuchta the man heading off the pitch and he has been replaced by tecl prior to this game slavia had lost just

the man coming off and he has been replaced by elneny winning the europa league may be arsenal s only chance of guaranteeing european football next season as they are currently ninth in the premier league table p olayinka yellow card olayinka has been booked after there is a coming together with a few players from both sides after a poor challenge from xhaka on kuchta the striker reacts badly and is shown a yellow card for dissent arsenal win a free kick down the right wing after sevcik fouls smith rowe and pepe whips it into the box but slavia defend it well and clear the danger it could be a long game for these slavia players there is still half an hour left and they are showing no signs of getting back into the game arsenal look very comfortable chance lacazette has a great chance to make it four the striker is played through on goal down the left after a quick counter by the visitors and he shapes to shoot but dummies and cuts it back onto his right however he loses his footing and goes down under pressure nothing given by the referee the hosts win a free kick midway into the arsenal half and the set piece is delivered into the box and met by the head of olayinka however his header flies well over the arsenal goal the hosts don t seem to be trying particularly hard to pull a goal back they seem to be accepting defeat here i m sure to the disappointment of their supporters arsenal are without a clean sheet in their last seven games in european competition their longest run without a shutout since september they last went eight without a clean sheet in europe in a run of ending in march as it stands arsenal will play villarreal in the semi finals as they are currently beating dinamo zagreb which makes it on aggregate this will set up a meeting with former gunners boss unai emery will the slavia half time substitutes be able to make the difference arsenal are dominating once again and look eager to score a few more the second half is under way o lingr n stanciu stanciu also heads off and lingr is his replacement l masopust j hromada hromada was booked in the first half so he comes off and he has been replaced by masopust d vi insk a bah another change by the hosts sees bah replaced by visinsky o dorley j bo il slavia have made four substitutions ahead of the second half with boril one of those coming off and he has been replaced by dorley surely arsenal have done enough to secure their passage now with slavia having to score four goals in order to progress and so far they haven t tested leno at all arsenal are cruising through to the semi finals of the europa league after three goals in the space of six minutes have put them ahead and this makes it on aggregate smith rowe had an earlier goal ruled out for offside but just a minute later pepe opened the scoring lacazette then doubled their lead from the penalty spot before saka made it three on minutes half time sparta prague arsenal on aggregate there will be a minimum of two minutes added time played at the end of the first half arsenal are still trying to break forward with pace and numbers when they can and they are finding plenty of space in behind in order to do so there s not long left to play before the end of the first half can arsenal get another goal before the half time whistle arsenal are keeping the ball very nicely in midfield they are full of confidence and look very content the hosts just don t have the answers for them at the moment wild effort long ball over the top for olayinka to run onto he backheels it from the byline to bah and he fires a powerful strike towards goal however he gets it all wrong and it flies high over the arsenal goal it looks like xhaka is playing at left back again for arsenal just as he did against sheffield united when he wasn t tested this could be an area that the hosts try to exploit penalty shout holding goes to fire an effort towards goal after slavia fail to deal with a corner and the centre back picks up the loose ball however just as he goes to shoot a slavia defender gets in his way and holding strikes his leg nothing given and it would have been a harsh one despite slavia now needing to score four goals they aren t throwing players forward in search of one so far a lot of their passes are either sideways or backwards the locals had been very vocal in the stands but the three arsenal goals have knocked them off their stride can slavia pull one back before the break the hosts look stunned by what has happened in the opening period of the game they seemed so confident prior to the disallowed goal and since then it has been all arsenal on the last eight occasions where arsenal drew the first leg of a two legged european knockout tie the gunners progressed to the next round just four times while they have been eliminated the last three times they drew a first leg at home c chambers assist the goal is all about the brilliance from saka down the right wing but it was chambers who spotted the run of his team mate and he easily picked him out b saka goal goal arsenal have a third saka once again sprints through the slavia defence down the right wing he then cuts inside onto his left foot and drills the ball straight into the bottom right corner of the net kolar couldn t get anywhere near it surely that is game over these two goals now mean that arsenal are up on aggregate and slavia now need to score three in order to win the game a lacazette penalty goal goal arsenal double their lead from the penalty spot it s lacazette steps up to take the spot kick after saka was brought down by hromada the arsenal skipper shows great composure to send kolar the wrong way and slide the ball into the bottom right corner of the net j hromada yellow card hromada is booked for his foul on saka that hands arsenal a penalty and the opportunity to make it arsenal penalty what a start by arsenal they are flying now and a second away goal would be massive for them the gunners counter quickly and catch slavia out at the back saka takes on hromada and the midfielder clatters into him the referee immediately points to the spot e smith rowe assist smith rowe has soon forgotten about his disallowed goal a few moments ago as he superbly sets up pepe for the opening goal the slavia defenders thought he was going to shoot so put him under a lot of pressure but instead he flicks it out to pepe who makes no mistakes with a great finish n p p goal goal this time the goal will stand arsenal make it brilliant play by smith rowe on the edge of the box he tries to work space for a shot himself but can t find a way through so instead he flicks it out wide to pepe the winger sprints towards the keeper and could have gone down under pressure but instead he coolly chips it over kolar and into the back of the net goal ruled out the opening goal by arsenal is disallowed after a long var review it deems that smith rowe was offside has the shot came in from saka so it remains on the night there will be a var check on the goal as smith rowe had a couple of glances towards the linesman to see if he was onside or not and it var are going to take a look at this it looks very tight goal arsenal take the lead smith rowe fires them ahead it s it comes from their first attack of the game with saka getting forward down the right wing he then cuts inside onto his left foot and fires a curling shot towards the bottom left corner of the net however the slavia keeper makes a superb save tipping it onto the post fortunately for arsenal it falls straight into the path of smith rowe who has a tap in from just a few yards out however there is a question of offside so we ll have to wait and see there isn t much attacking intent by either side at the moment it is the hosts who are seeing more of the ball but arsenal aren t pressuring them high up the pitch in an attempt to win it back quickly slavia prague have kept a clean sheet in four of their last six home games in european competition conceding just three goals in total in this run slavia look pretty comfortable in possession at the moment they hold the advantage due to away goals so if it remained goalless here they would progress arsenal have to push forward at some point and score almost really good move by arsenal down the left wing and pepe sprints foward takes on his marker and then squares it to ceballos who shapes to fire an effort towards goal however slavia get players back in time and nick the ball off his toes it is now slavia who are keeping the ball nicely in midfield they are keeping arsenal inside their own half soaking up the pressure an early goal would be massive here arsenal win an early corner here after the visitors press forward quickly and pepe s cross is blocked behind for a set piece however the hosts comfortably clear the danger we re under way the teams are out on the pitch and kick off is just a few minutes away stay tuned for all the match action meanwhile mikel arteta has made just one changes to his side with martinelli dropping down to the bench after he picked up a slight knock at the weekend smith rowe replaces him in the starting xi the

fires a powerful strike towards goal however he gets it all wrong and it flies high over the arsenal goal it looks like xhaka is playing at left back again for arsenal just as he did against sheffield united when he wasn t tested this could be an area that the hosts try to exploit penalty shout holding goes to fire an effort towards goal after slavia fail to deal with a corner and the centre back picks up the loose ball however just as he goes to shoot a slavia defender gets in his way and holding strikes his leg nothing given and it would have been a harsh one despite slavia now needing to score four goals they aren t throwing players forward in search of one so far a lot of their passes are either sideways or backwards the locals had been very vocal in the stands but the three arsenal goals have knocked them off their stride can slavia pull one back before the break the hosts look stunned by what has happened in the opening period of the game they seemed so confident prior to the disallowed goal and since then it has been all arsenal on the last eight occasions where arsenal drew the first leg of a two legged european knockout tie the gunners progressed to the next round just four times while they have been eliminated the last three times they drew a first leg at home c chambers assist the goal is all about the brilliance from saka down the right wing but it was chambers who spotted the run of his team mate and he easily picked him out b saka goal goal arsenal have a third saka once again sprints through the slavia defence down the right wing he then cuts inside onto his left foot and drills the ball straight into the bottom right corner of the net kolar couldn t get anywhere near it surely that is game over these two goals now mean that arsenal are up on aggregate and slavia now need to score three in order to win the game a lacazette penalty goal goal arsenal double their lead from the penalty spot it s lacazette steps up to take the spot kick after saka was brought down by hromada the arsenal skipper shows great composure to send kolar the wrong way and slide the ball into the bottom right corner of the net j hromada yellow card hromada is booked for his foul on saka that hands arsenal a penalty and the opportunity to make it arsenal penalty what a start by arsenal they are flying now and a second away goal would be massive for them the gunners counter quickly and catch slavia out at the back saka takes on hromada and the midfielder clatters into him the referee immediately points to the spot e smith rowe assist smith rowe has soon forgotten about his disallowed goal a few moments ago as he superbly sets up pepe for the opening goal the slavia defenders thought he was going to shoot so put him under a lot of pressure but instead he flicks it out to pepe who makes no mistakes with a great finish n p p goal goal this time the goal will stand arsenal make it brilliant play by smith rowe on the edge of the box he tries to work space for a shot himself but can t find a way through so instead he flicks it out wide to pepe the winger sprints towards the keeper and could have gone down under pressure but instead he coolly chips it over kolar and into the back of the net goal ruled out the opening goal by arsenal is disallowed after a long var review it deems that smith rowe was offside has the shot came in from saka so it remains on the night there will be a var check on the goal as smith rowe had a couple of glances towards the linesman to see if he was onside or not and it var are going to take a look at this it looks very tight goal arsenal take the lead smith rowe fires them ahead it s it comes from their first attack of the game with saka getting forward down the right wing he then cuts inside onto his left foot and fires a curling shot towards the bottom left corner of the net however the slavia keeper makes a superb save tipping it onto the post fortunately for arsenal it falls straight into the path of smith rowe who has a tap in from just a few yards out however there is a question of offside so we ll have to wait and see there isn t much attacking intent by either side at the moment it is the hosts who are seeing more of the ball but arsenal aren t pressuring them high up the pitch in an attempt to win it back quickly slavia prague have kept a clean sheet in four of their last six home games in european competition conceding just three goals in total in this run slavia look pretty comfortable in possession at the moment they hold the advantage due to away goals so if it remained goalless here they would progress arsenal have to push forward at some point and score almost really good move by arsenal down the left wing and pepe sprints foward takes on his marker and then squares it to ceballos who shapes to fire an effort towards goal however slavia get players back in time and nick the ball off his toes it is now slavia who are keeping the ball nicely in midfield they are keeping arsenal inside their own half soaking up the pressure an early goal would be massive here arsenal win an early corner here after the visitors press forward quickly and pepe s cross is blocked behind for a set piece however the hosts comfortably clear the danger we re under way the teams are out on the pitch and kick off is just a few minutes away stay tuned for all the match action meanwhile mikel arteta has made just one changes to his side with martinelli dropping down to the bench after he picked up a slight knock at the weekend smith rowe replaces him in the starting xi the hosts have made four changes to their starting line up with kacharaba dorley masopust and lingr all dropping out of the team with bah sevcik hromada and olayinka coming into the side arsenal subs mat

points off the top five travel to brighton and hove albion on saturday man city mark their return to premier league action with a comfortable win over man arsenal david luiz s error gifted sterling the opening goal late in the first half and the centre back brought on for the injured mari then saw red for giving away a penalty that de bruyne converted foden added a third in stoppage time after fellow substitute aguero s shot had come back off the post full time manchester city arsenal manchester city midfielder phil foden has more goal involvements this season in all competitions four goals and seven assists than his previous two campaigns side netting foden plays the ball into the feet of aguero and the striker has only leno to beat he takes the shot slightly early and slices it somewhat only managing to pick out the side netting wide bernardo skews a shot wide of the target after being picked out by gundogan who has had a good game today the hosts are knocking the ball around with the swagger of a side three goals to the good they look as though they have a fourth goal in them before the end of the game there was an impressive deep pass from fernandinho in the build up to that third city goal showing just why guardiola is so keen to use him at centre back if arsenal were not already out of the contest they certainly are now p foden goal gooooaaaallll man city arsenal aguero clips the ball over leno at the end of a counter the ball hits the post and foden is first to the rebound the young midfielder making no mistake with his finish into an unguarded net eleven minutes have been added on at the end of the game city down to men garcia is taken down the tunnel on a stretcher fingers crossed he is okay after that nasty collision with ederson guardiola has already used all five substitutions so it is against for the remainder of the game city defender garcia is still being treated on the field the physios understandably cannot take any risks given it is a head injury there could well be more than minutes added on here when factoring in all the subs there are some worried looks on the faces of city s players after seeing one of their team mates possibly knocked unconscious this injury has taken up about six minutes now which will no doubt be added on at the end garcia may well have been knocked out by ederson the physios will take all the time they need to ensure the young defender is safely placed on the stretcher ederson races out of his box and in an attempt to win the ball takes out team mate garcia it looks a nasty one with ederson seemingly catching garcia in the face the city physios are on the pitch and the stretcher is also brought on s ag ero gabriel jesus guardiola turns to aguero for the final minutes the argentina striker will take the place of jesus up top rodri yellow card rodrigo is the latest player to enter the referee s book for a foul on ceballos nearly a third sterling catches out the opposition by passing the free kick to gundogan rather than taking on the shot as expected gundogan is unable to beat leno though with the arsenal keeper undoubtedly their best player today making a low save k tierney yellow card tierney catches gundogan on the ankle after the ball had gone and is shown a yellow card play picks up from where it left off before the water break as city continue to pass the ball around arsenal it has been far too easy for the hosts ever since they opened the scoring late in the first half it is time for another water break at the etihad stadium arteta and guardiola have a chance to speak to their players there is absolutely no pressure on the ball now from city s perspective as they continue to play it around arsenal the man visitors seem happy to settle for just a two goal defeat rodri k de bruyne de bruyne is given a breather now with rodrigo introduced in central midfield fernandinho aymeric laporte laporte is taken off with minutes to go the versatile fernandinho is on in his place save de bruyne makes a smart run into the box and is spotted by sterling his drilled shot is kept out by leno in a fairly routine manner r nelson j willock nelson takes over from willock in the last of arsenal s changes a maitland niles m guendouzi maitland niles is brought on for guendouzi and will slot into central midfield a lacazette e nketiah arteta makes a triple substitution with less than minutes to salvage something nketiah is on for lacazette in the first of those changes bernardo silva david silva silva is off and namesake bernardo on in the second of city s changes p foden r mahrez guardiola turns to his bench for the first today time by bringing on foden for mahrez arsenal are not out of this game yet given there are only two goals in it but they are offering absolutely nothing at the moment city are cruising through the match with their latest attacking move culminating in leno getting down to cut out a cross city s players are simply knocking the ball around between them now arteta is holding off from making his third change for the time being arsenal defender david luiz has conceded four penalties in the premier league this season double the amount of any other player shot guendouzi does not close down jesus quickly enough and the city striker takes range from yards the shot is central and leno has a straightforward save to make david luiz is the first player to be sent off concede a penalty and commit an error leading to an opposition goal in a premier league match since carl jenkinson for west ham v bournemouth in august tierney cuts out mahrez s right sided cross before jesus can pounce guardiola may well be tempted to make a change or two of his own as we approach the hour mark in manchester arteta is trying to work out what to do next mustafi is limping along following that challenge from sterling so a bad day may be about to get even worse for the visitors sterling lunges in on mustafi with a scissor type challenge arsenal s players want the city forward sent off but the referee does not even reach into his pocket k de bruyne penalty goal goooooaaaaaallll man city arsenal de bruyne sends the penalty towards the bottom right corner and leno dives the opposite way city have a two goal lead and a one man advantage david luiz red card david luiz at fault for city s first goal is also showed a red card for that challenge penalty to man city mahrez chests down the ball and gets the wrong side of luiz the arsenal centre back brings down his opponent inside the box and the hosts have a penalty arsenal hit city on the counter saka plays it down the line to willock but his back heeled pass inside the box does not come off ederson goes long and mahrez looks to be in only for a bad first touch to let him down and leno to gather the home side are in no rush to get the ball forward in the early stages of the second half arsenal are unable to get their foot on it at the moment restart man city leading thanks to sterling s strike get us back up and running at the etihad stadium neither coach made any changes at the interval so it is as you were arsenal lost xhaka and mari to injury in the opening minutes of the match but arteta still has three substitutions available and may well choose to use one at the break pepe lacazette and martinelli are all among the visitors subs while city can call upon the likes of aguero sane and bernardo city take a lead into half time thanks to sterling s strike right at the end of the first half with the england international profiting from some terrible david luiz defending it is a deserved advantage for guardiola s men having tested opposition goalkeeper leno five times before sterling s breakthrough goal half time manchester city arsenal raheem sterling has been directly involved in six goals in his last seven premier league appearances for manchester city against arsenal four goals and two assists r sterling goal gooooooaaaaalllll man city arsenal city take the lead right at the end of the first half through sterling s first goal of david luiz fails to cut out de bruyne s pretty weak pass from the right and sterling puts his foot through it when one on one with leno poor from david luiz that three minutes have been added on at the end of the so far goalless first half at the etihad stadium walker backs into tierney and arsenal have a rare chance to test city from a deep free kick saka s delivery is brilliant but it drops just in front of mustafi and the centre back fails to make any contact arteta could do with half time because city are knocking on the door for a breakthrough goal if not for leno s heroics the reigning champions would be a goal or two ahead as we approach the interval chance for sterling arsenal are seriously holding on now de bruyne plays a simple pass through for sterling who attempts to dink the ball over leno with just the goalkeeper to beat he gets too much on it and the ball spins over the crossbar leno denies mahrez leno is keeping arsenal in this game he makes a third save in pretty much the same number of minutes this time denying mahrez from close range after the winger was played in by de bruyne that was a well worked move from city they are now bossing things in terms of possession and are starting to create some good opportunities another leno stop city are definitely growing more and more into this game silva gets in behind the arsenal defence and fires a low shot across goal which leno is again equal to ceballos is first to the loose ball good save sterling cuts inside bellerin and bends a shot towards the bottom right corner leno does well to get down and push the ball behind for a corner that is as close as city have come today garcia is all over nketiah as he sends his opponent crashing to the ground just outside the city box but the referee anthony taylor waves play on city are slowly starting to find their groove de bruyne exchanges passes with gundogan yards from goal and pulls the trigger though his shot is blocked by an arsenal player david luiz intercepts the ball and plays it to ceballos who drifts into a central position from the left a cross eventually comes in from the right but walker is able to chest it back to ederson arsenal are unbeaten in their last seven away league games with each of their last five in a row ending level the north london club have never drawn six consecutive away league games de bruyne turns down the chance to shoot from the edge of the box and instead attempts to slip in mahrez the algeria winger cannot bring it under control however and a promising attack for city fizzles out saka s early cross from the right is aimed too close to ederson de bruyne gives away possession as city attempt to play it out from the back but aubameyang s shot from the edge of the box is off target david luiz pablo mar david luiz is brought on for mari with a little over a quarter of the contest played arsenal have already lost two players to injury experienced centre back david luiz is stripping down ready to come on it is a second injury blow for arteta with less than a quarter of the game played walker powers away from mari down the right hand side and cuts the ball back but nobody in a sky blue shirt can get on the end of it worryingly for arteta mari pulled up with a possible calf injury city are patiently probing away with arsenal dropping off perhaps a tad too deep bellerin gets to the ball ahead of walker down the left but any hope of a quick break is thwarted by garcia with minutes played possession is split exactly down the middle there has been very little between the teams so far with both sides still trying to feel their way into the contest walker gets across to cut out a cross at the expense of a corner the set piece is headed away by jesus at the front post nketiah has looked very sharp in the opening minutes or so the former leeds united loanee has got in behind garcia a couple of times city cannot afford to give him too many sights of goal wide saka sends in a cross towards nketiah the arsenal striker gets in front of a wrong footed garcia but is unable to direct the ball on target it is very compact in midfield at the moment arsenal are enjoying a spell on the ball but like city are not doing a lot with it other than recycling it between their defenders and midfielders city are seeing plenty of the ball at the moment without doing a great deal with it jesus tries to chase down a pass in behind but it has too much on it and goes out for a goal kick city win another corner which de bruyne swings towards the six yard box mari heads it as far as mahrez whose shot takes a touch on its way behind for a goal kick dani ceballos g xhaka ceballos is brought on for the injured xhaka in a like for like change in holding midfield it does not look good for xhaka the stretcher is now on the field so it is fair to say his match and possibly even his season is over just seven minutes into the restart xhaka collides with team mate guendouzi and is in need of some treatment the arsenal midfielder appears to have injured his right ankle and may well have to make way early on save de bruyne whips the free kick around the wall leno watches it all the way and palms the ball over the crossbar mari catches sterling when attempting to clear the ball a yard or so outside his own penalty area city have a free kick in shooting range with de bruyne one of two players stood over the ball nketiah gets between city s two centre backs and chases down leno s long pass he is through on goal but his shot is pretty terrible and the offside would have denied him anyway as was the case in the aston villa versus sheffield united match a little earlier every man city and arsenal player took a knee in support of the black lives matter movement before the first ball was kicked kick off following a minute s silence to remember all those who have lost their lives to coronavirus arsenal get us underway at the etihad stadium the teams are coming out onto the pitch at the etihad stadium with kick off just moments away this match will be played behind closed doors as will every other premier league game between now and the end of the season manchester city have won their last six matches against arsenal in all competitions their best ever run against the londoners with five of those victories coming in the premier league arsenal show five changes from their slender win over west ham in early march the big news is that mesut ozil is left out of the matchday squad despite arteta confirming pre match that the german midfielder is not injured sokratis also misses out entirely while pepe ceballos and david luiz drop down to the bench bellerin mustafi guendouzi willock and saka are all recalled to a youthful xi guardiola has made eight changes to city s starting line up following their manchester derby defeat a little over

have a ball my little girl wants to play with it it was a question that the manager of a local boys team in essex used to hear every weekend he probably did not realise though that little girl would go on to become one of arsenal s most promising academy products one fans were disappointed to see join rivals manchester city in the summer of ruby mace featured off the bench a few times for the gunners first team before a productive loan spell with fellow women s super league side birmingham in but after years at arsenal she would sign her first professional contract elsewhere editors picks mamelodi sundowns sirino would price tag be a stumbling block for kaizer chiefs and orlando pirates romain emperor psg transfer target faivre ready for the big time has khune given kaizer chiefs coach baxter something to think about from title glory to a m divorce inside conte s tumultuous chelsea tenure when i got the call to say man city wanted me it was very hard but i feel like it wasn t as hard as i thought it was mace an england youth international tells goal having had several months to reflect on her decision this is a big club and both teams wanted the best for me but i feel like the plan man city put out for me was going to benefit me more than what arsenal put out for me i feel like an opportunity like this i couldn t turn it down it was on the sidelines as a child while watching her older brother play that mace started to forge the path that led to that first pro deal she was just four years old when her mother encouraged her to try out for a boys team just one pitch over mace was successful and with her new team was scouted by west ham where she played for a year then aged six came the chance to join arsenal the impact the gunners had on her is evident her technical ability stands out particularly her ability to use both feet something she recalls there being big emphasis on at arsenal view this post on instagram the tactical focus would come later helping to develop mace into not only a talented young player but a very versatile one i used to play right back when i was five six years old the now year old says then when i went to arsenal you played everywhere every position a different position every game i was a winger one game then i was left back and then i just grew into playing midfield and centre back it is the latter that has grown to be her favourite mace spent the second half of last season playing in midfield for birmingham an experience that taught her a lot about herself check out football s best wonderkids with nxgn julio enciso libertad andreas schjelderup fc nordsjaelland edouard michut psg i feel like every young player needs to experience that before then deciding what they want to do mace says i could have gone to birmingham and i might not have been at the level to then move to man city i might have had to go to the championship i feel like once i did that i thought to myself if i keep working hard then i can be capable of this big move i feel like that really like determined my next move that transfer was never going to be easy for a year old very close to her family but mace has always known it is not easy to reach the top when i was younger i used to have this one to one coach he always used to talk to me about cristiano ronaldo because ronaldo had a hard childhood with his family and stuff and he had to work for what he had she remembers when i was younger i used to idolise him because i feel he s had a much harder journey than me but mine has still been hard with family and stuff while adjusting to the move to manchester the hardest thing in mace s career so far her first summer with city was a strange one only a handful of players were in training and no pre season fixtures were scheduled due to the number of players involved in the olympic games and some injuries view this post on instagram but it gave mace opportunity to spend every day with england international alex greenwood which both she and head coach gareth taylor have highlighted as being very valuable i quite idolise alex mace says i feel like she s a very good role model to me and she s always helped me she s always guided me through training even if at times i m not doing what i need to be doing she ll come and make sure i m alright i feel like being around her brings out my game in a better way which is really good for me i had six months to prove that i don t need to go out on loan i ve spoken to gareth about that how that s my main target for the season to prove to him that i am good enough to work hard in training and show that i don t need to be a loan player she has made great strides doing that over the last couple of months in november she made her wsl debut for city and has completed minutes on four occasions since across the league and continental cup mace has shown that she is ready to perform for taylor s side both this season and in the long term and city believe

conte s tumultuous chelsea tenure nizaar kinsella sast the tottenham boss time at stamford bridge ended in acrimony but the italian remains the last manager to lead the blues to premier league glory chelsea s relationship with antonio conte ended in court and ultimately cost the blues million m making it the most costly divorce in football history when the blues sacked the italian in they argued that he was not entitled to the usual severance package because of alleged breaches of contract during his second and final year at stamford bridge the judges ruled in conte s favour though and he split the compensation received with his staff members editors picks mamelodi sundowns sirino would price tag be a stumbling block for kaizer chiefs and orlando pirates romain emperor psg transfer target faivre ready for the big time has khune given kaizer chiefs coach baxter something to think about is rafael leao really the new henry ibrahimovic s little brother finally realising potential at ac milan it was a shame that the coach s time in west london had ended in such acrimony and surprising too given it had started so promisingly indeed in his first year in charge conte transformed a side that had finished th the season before into premier league champions a switch to a formation which hadn t often been seen in england sparked a game winning run that led to his side romping to the title the blues went close to pulling off a domestic double in but they were beaten in the fa cup final by arsenal however they would return to wembley the following year to lift the trophy following a victory over manchester united two major trophies in two seasons would normally guarantee at least another year at the helm for a manager but conte s tenure had already began to unravel before the end of the campaign the first signs of tension at stamford bridge actually appeared during the january transfer window after diego costa pushed for a m m move to chinese super league club tianjin quanjian the blues forced the brazil born spain international to stay put and he played a key role in their subsequent title triumph however conte then informed costa that he was not part of his future plans via text message while the striker was on holiday costa was furious and partook in several interviews where he claimed he had been treated like a dog inside the club many blamed conte for his insensitive handling of the situation and believed he should have let club director marina granovskaia deal with costa s exit nonetheless after their title success which secured a return to the champions league chelsea sought to strengthen a squad that conte did not believe was sufficiently equipped to challenge for trophies in both england and europe the blues brought in several players but not necessarily all of those on conte s ambitious wishlist having already been left disappointed by seeing top target virgil van dijk leave southampton for liverpool for a then record fee for a defender m m conte was further frustrated by missing out on leonardo bonucci who left juventus for ac milan in the summer of conte was also keen on alex oxlade chamberlain romelu lukaku and kyle walker while the blues also had an significant bid turned down for ac milan s alessio romagnoli and even approached bayern munich s robert lewandowski during the lecce native s time at the club however for the campaign chelsea had instead brought in alvaro morata tiemoue bakayoko danny drinkwater and davide zappacosta in what many believe to be the club s most disastrous transfer window in recent times unsurprisingly chelsea were quickly left behind by manchester city in the title race and in november influential technical director michael emenalo left the club by mutual consent which was hugely significant as it meant that the mediator between conte and granovskaia was removed from the equation what followed almost inevitably was a series of bitter and depressing press conferences in which conte publicly expressed his unhappiness with chelsea s transfer business chelsea are still counting the cost of the campaign to this day as the january arrivals of olivier giroud emerson palmieri and ross barkley took their overall outlay that season to m m the blues did still lift the fa cup but they finished fifth in the premier league which saw them fall back out of the champions league it quickly became clear during the summer that followed that chlesea wanted to bring in maurizio sarri as their new manager but his arrival was held up by napoli s ultimately successful attempt to make the m m signing of jorginho part of the deal as it was though conte was actually forced to take the first three training sessions of the new season as he awaited his fate he arguably deserved better but looking back at the whole affair it would be unfair to portray either side as a hero or villain it was just another dramatic episode in the turbulent world of chelsea who have forked out around m m in severance pay to sacked managers since roman abramovich bought the club in conte for his part has always been reluctant to shed much light on his chelsea tenure i spent two seasons where i created a good relationship with players staff people who work at chelsea the now tottenham coach said ahead of the first of three meetings with his former employers this month we did a really good job and i think in my position i don t have to prove anything to anyone i m a manager that has the experience to do important jobs at other teams and it ll be a pleasure for me to come back to

conte s time in charge too he was often warm and engaging whenever he met supporters out and about in london and he grew to love english football after struggling to even speak the language when he first arrived when chelsea sealed a aggregate win over spurs in the semi finals of the carabao cup with a victory at the tottenham last week those in the away end sang antonio antonio antonio it wasn t an ironic dig at conte or his side of course it is easier to profess love from a position of strength but there is still a genuine affection there for their former manager chelsea fans identified with conte s passion work ethic and intensity the blues may have long since moved on but there remains a significant amount of respect for the so often divisive figure who will take a seat in the away

pressure has been piled upon directors marina granovskaia and michael emenalo after a series of rejections around transfer deadline day the outrage is generally amplified on social media but fans were unhappy with the transfer chiefs despite the six signings that the club brought in over the past few months chelsea s initial signings of alvaro morata tiemoue bakayoko antonio rudiger and willy

stumbling block for kaizer chiefs and orlando pirates romain emperor psg transfer target faivre ready for the big time has khune given kaizer chiefs coach baxter something to think about from title glory to a m divorce inside conte s tumultuous chelsea tenure however even with the estimated million outlay chelsea are ever so slightly short on playing staff they lack cover in the striker wing back and centre back positions while they have sold around m of fringe loan and youth players in the past six months the net spend at the club isn t as big as it looks and complaints over sales of youngsters is an inevitability nathaniel chalobah bertrand traore and nathan ake have buy back clauses but grievances will remain about the club s youth policy and their lack of chances in the first team chelsea have avoided a crisis over a lack of first team options but it has been painful to watch a series of rejections in the past hours has left chelsea the victim of many jokes but it also raises questions of how the club allowed themselves to be manipulated and played alex oxlade chamberlain didn t want to play at wing back and chose to go to liverpool despite chelsea agreeing a million fee with arsenal for him after that fernando llorente chose tottenham over chelsea despite months of the blues tracking the former swansea frontman ross barkley ended up wasting chelsea s time as they negotiated a deal for an injured player only for it to fall through rewind to july and romelu lukaku chose old trafford ahead of a return to stamford bridge interest in juventus alex sandro was quickly blocked as leonardo bonucci was sold to ac milan and the serie a champions had to avoid outrage of their own over player sales manchester city outbid chelsea for real madrid s danilo which highlights how the club is becoming more keen on profitability they are no longer willing or able to blow rivals away as they did in the early roman abramovich years after losing out on several wing backs zappacosta is joined by kenedy he is back in the fold at chelsea depsite his controversial comments on instagram that offended many people in china kenedy is talented but his comments are a problem with chelsea aiming to grow their market share in asia chelsea are no longer the big bad wolves of the transfer market they have downsized looking to emulate a premier league version of the borussia dortmund model where sell on value becomes important the chaos of the final days of the transfer market came around and chelsea looked to find a bargain but it represents a culture shift for new fans who may find it irritating to miss out on the world s biggest stars manchester united manchester city tottenham and liverpool have pushed themselves to move forwards in the transfer market chelsea meanwhile have stood still but they have made a healthy profit from their share of the premier league s billion commercial deals not to mention their m a year nike contract they are now a profitable venture conte has called for patience and already warned that this season could be difficult he has moved to rein in expectations as he recognises that his squad may lack both depth and quality to fight to win the champions league this year however conte can make a success of it he has already won a premier league title against all odds so he may just have to win a second one in the

romain faivre is certainly not a young man lacking in confidence he has been in the news for two primary reasons in january firstly an impudent panenka against a covid stricken bordeaux side in the coupe de france infuriated brest s ligue rivals who felt that he was purposely humiliating them days later rumours over a potential move to paris saint germain began to circulate editors picks mamelodi sundowns sirino would price tag be a stumbling block for kaizer chiefs and orlando pirates has khune given kaizer chiefs coach baxter something to think about from title glory to a m divorce inside conte s tumultuous chelsea tenure is rafael leao really the new henry ibrahimovic s little brother finally realising potential at ac milan the brest midfielder has spent the last months entertaining ligue fans with his graceful brand of football impressing at a club that traditionally does not earn much media coverage or garner much interest he has brought both but while psg are set to have a restrained transfer window the former monaco youth player appears on the shortlist of the parc des princes side this january speaking to canal he has made it clear he would be open to a move to play for psg there s been contact with my agent he explained a week ago it s a dream it s my city my family and my friends are there previously he had been heavily courted by serie a club milan only for the deal to break down as the italians offer of million m m was deemed insufficient view this post on instagram certainly with his easy technique and graceful style he would have been a fitting addition to the rossoneri ranks and he made it clear to brest that he was not happy at being unable to leave for san siro indeed he was even exiled from the squad on one occasion as a result of his outspoken nature which player in the brest squad would not be flattered by ac milan s interest he told ouest france i had contact with them but i m not obsessed i made it clear that in football i have high goals and ambitions if faivre is assured in his own ability he has been wise enough to build a team around him that will allow him to thrive he has his own physical trainer a mental trainer a nutritionist almost like one would expect from an individual athlete i m just preparing to be above the others i pay attention to my physique my diet my sleep i m putting all these little details together to help me get to a team like ac milan he said he left monaco at the age of having played just four first team games and there was little widespread expectation on him when he arrived at brest in the summer of his background work though clearly did the trick he hit the ground running scoring four goals and creating three more before christmas and even if he faded a little in the second half of the campaign he had shown enough to persuade milan to make an approach his influence has only grown this season albeit it has been dulled by playing in a side that has struggled to excel nevertheless with seven goals and five assists he has already beaten his scoring tally from last season and lies just one short in the other statistic perhaps what has been most impressive about the left sided player is that he has been equally effective in a number of different roles over the past months an ability to play left centre or right midfield in an attacking style offers versatility while his dribbling qualities mean he has the capacity to open up tightly packed defences given that he is no slouch defensively there is a lot to like about his game he will not be easy to capture with a contract that runs until all the power lies with brest and they have indicated they do not want to sell we re calm sporting director gregory lorenzi told l equipe at the end of december we want to keep romain until the end of the season and we don t want him to leave this winter but if there s an offer we can t refuse we ll study it our first thought is that he ll stay and we ll reanalyse his situation next summer a move to psg would doubtless be a big step up but faivre has shown he has it in his locker to prove his doubters wrong while he has the focus and professional attitude that could take him far in the game he could prove a fine addition to the parc des princes club which has been leaning on kylian mbappe far too heavily for too long contact us

milan is rafael leao really the new henry ibrahimovic s little brother finally realising potential at ac milan mark doyle sast the best player in the history of sporting s academy has long been viewed as frustrating as he is talented but he is now delivering consistently there have never been any doubts over rafael leao s talent former sporting youth team coach tiago fernandes has always maintained that the almada native is the best player in the history of the academy better than paulo futre better than luis figo and yes even better than cristiano ronaldo at the same age editors picks mamelodi sundowns sirino would price tag be a stumbling block for kaizer chiefs and orlando pirates romain emperor psg transfer target faivre ready for the big time has khune given kaizer chiefs coach baxter something to think about from title glory to a m divorce inside conte s tumultuous chelsea tenure the big problem as far as fernandes was concerned was leao s complacency the feeling that pure talent alone would prove sufficient to propel him to the summit of the game it was strange too given leao idolised ronaldo a living legend renowned for his incredible work ethic cristiano is the best in the world the prodigiously gifted attacker told goal in he has made a successful career with a lot of hard work and is a great example to follow only leao didn t he quickly became as famous for his potential as his lethargy even during his solitary season at lille in then club president gerard lopez labelled leao the portuguese mbappe but coach christophe galtier admitted he s a player who can make you pull your hair out but a few minutes later bring you a lot of hope and a smile ac milan certainly felt leao was a risk worth taking and paid million m m for his services in august he scored six times during his debut season in serie a showing numerous flashes of his awesome ability however leao was still frustrating fans coaches and team mates club sources revealed that he sometimes cut a distracted almost disinterested figure in training when zlatan ibrahimovic rejoined milan in january he immediately took his fellow forward under his wing even leao soon began referring to the swedish striking icon as his big brother since he arrived he s been talking to me giving me advice on how to improve how to position myself in the penalty area the portuguese explained he s a great player and i want to learn as much as i can with him by my side ibrahimovic though felt that too much of what he was telling leao was going in one ear and out the other no matter what he said he couldn t quite seem to get through to leao to make him realise just what was expected of a top professional then during the summer leao totally changed as ibrahimovic put it he understood himself what to do the swede told corriere tv for leao the penny had dropped he couldn t get by just turning it on for minutes here and there he accepted what ibrahimovic milan coach stefano pioli his parents and his personal trainer were all telling him he needed to be on it each and every week for minutes god has given me the talent which is rare but i must add sacrifices and hard work he admitted in an interview with la repubblica in november i have a talent to cultivate but you don t play alone in football and i ve proved that i can make it at milan he s most certainly done that over the past few months rafael leao comes up big for ac milan pic twitter com vugvcamdv goal january just over halfway through the campaign leao has as many goals in all competitions eight as he s ever previously managed as a professional over the course of an entire season in addition he s also contributed four assists has completed more dribbles than any other player based in serie a and is now set to be rewarded with a bumper new contract the upturn in form has also resulted in the mbappe comparisons resurfacing but stefano pioli feels leao is more similar to another famous french forward he reminds me a lot of thierry henry the milan coach told reporters earlier this month given pioli is hardly a man renowned for making outlandish statements the comparison provoked plenty of debate in italy however it has been backed up by the likes of nicola amoruso and alessio tacchinardi both of whom were on juventus books when henry spent six months in turin in the young henry is the leao of today tacchinardi told tuttosport the characteristics of the two players are the same you see the pace in one on ones and they always go on the outside to break through the opponent s defence i was slaughtered on social media for this comparison but just compare the videos and there s nothing else to say they re the same amoruso is in total agreement but he added in an interview with the gazzetta dello sport leao just has to better understand how strong he is once he does this nobody will stop him and this leads us on to the great contradiction in leao s character for all of his faith in his natural talent he still doesn t seem to have fully grasped just how far he can go italian coaching icon fabio capello and pioli have also said the same thing leao doesn t yet realise the enormity of his potential still it s clear from both recent statements and recent performances that the player himself has at least started to see the merits of adding industry to innovation i think he has to convince himself and work a lot on his mentality to try to become even more ambitious added pioli whom leao views as a reference point in his career one with his means must think of getting to the top of the world but talent is not enough he understands that he has to work in a certain way and work with others encouragingly leao now forms one of the most formidable left flanks in europe alongside theo hernandez with the pair combining to devastating effect to torment opposition right backs indeed how juventus cope with milan s dual threat out wide will go a long way towards determining the outcome of sunday s massive serie a showdown at san siro leao is clearly not the finished article he cannot be compared to the henry that arsene wenger transformed into arguably the finest attacking talent the premier league has ever seen still there are undeniable similarities to the henry that toiled in turin for six months there is the sensational speed the devastating dribbling skills and the valuable versatility of course a key difference is that while leao is flourishing out wide under pioli henry floundered under ancelotti however as tacchinardi pointed out the portugal international is another diamond in the rough one that could yet be polished into something quite spectacular and the signs are that after a couple of seasons of frustration which required an immense amount of patience from pioli co milan are finally well placed to succeed with leao where juve failed with henry contact us terms of service privacy policy copyright goal south africa all

and petrol stations to drinking water and instant noodles editors picks mamelodi sundowns sirino would price tag be a stumbling block for kaizer chiefs and orlando pirates romain emperor psg transfer target faivre ready for the big time has khune given kaizer chiefs coach baxter something to think about from title glory to a m divorce inside conte s tumultuous chelsea tenure his most recent passion project has been the promotion of tennis in ghana his baby jet promotions company sponsoring multiple events and tournaments across the country he said in september ghanaians don t follow tennis like before i m appealing to the media to give tennis attention a bit football is the no sport and we respect that but tennis is my second love so this is what i am doing now his new life on the tennis court endured a rocky start when he had to apologise after he and his brother baffour gyan assaulted an opponent during a practice match in october however he remains involved with the sport in ghana even winning a doubles tournament alongside his sibling also a former international footballer in december last year he also attempted to start his own airline baby jet airlines but the covid pandemic has meant his plans for flight are yet to get off the ground perhaps the striker s most famous extra curricular activity has been his music career he recorded three albums with hiplife musician castro and the single african girls released at the height of his career in august was a hit you can listen to the song below and it s worthwhile it s a bop now gyan has not played since last summer when he left ghanaian club legon cities after failing to score in five league appearances however in august he insisted he has not finished with the game yet i have not retired from football there were some injuries last season but i am not done playing football he said in an interview with kessben fm i can wake up one day and announce my retirement from football but at the moment i am active people will criticise me but i am only hoping to get back to my normal form and weight if i am not able to regain my form then i will call it off i returned to legon cities and you could clearly see that things did not go as planned because i have put on weight but i am giving myself another season and i trust i will be back to my form and if i am on my form i don t think i will be overlooked so regards retirement not now view this post on instagram the ability to invest so widely comes from gyan s playing career which has seen him ply his trade all over europe and asia scoring goals for any club who could guarantee a sizable pay check at the end of the week he joined udinese from ghanaian club liberty professionals as a teenager and after establishing himself in europe first in serie a and then in ligue with rennes he was snapped up by sunderland for a club record million m on the final day of the summer transfer window thanks in no small part to his performances at the world cup in south africa gyan scored two crucial penalties in the group stage to help his country qualify for the knockout stage then the extra time winner in the round of clash with united states in the quarter final ghana looked set to become the first african side ever to reach the world cup semi finals when gyan was presented with a last gasp penalty against uruguay given after luis suarez had deliberately handled the ball on the goal line however he struck the bar with his spot kick and the black stars were then beaten in a shootout view this post on instagram gyan only spent one season on wearside but he remains a cult hero on account of his habit for netting key goals including a th minute equaliser against local rivals newcastle united he netted times in all competitions for sunderland but left in left in when uae side al ain offered him a loan deal later made permanent worth a reported a week gyan racked up goals in as many matches for al ain before joining shanghai sipg at the height of the super league s ambitious recruitment of overseas stars it s estimated that he earned m m during his two years in china which worked out at just under m per strike eight goals in matches stints back in the uae al ahli turkey kayserispor and india north east united were also well remunerated allowing gyan to turn his attention to his other interests this makes it likely despite his protestations that his days taking playing football seriously are long gone rather than featuring on the field gyan has been working as a pundit for supersport tv during the africa cup of nations he remains among the most notable names from the golden era of ghanaian football a story he posted to his instagram page of a friend being given a suitcase for free because the salesman was a sunderland fan exemplifies how big a star the forward was in his heyday and how much influence he continues to exert on the african game and beyond so what has asamoah gyan been up

previous continental campaign in when they suffered arguably their most humiliating result ever defeat to iceland in the last one major difference was the central midfield options gareth southgate had

sirino would price tag be a stumbling block for kaizer chiefs and orlando pirates romain emperor psg transfer target faivre ready for the big time has khune given kaizer chiefs coach baxter something to think about from title glory to a m divorce inside conte s tumultuous chelsea tenure in however roy hodgson had cobbled together an unappetising mix of an over the hill steven gerrard an out of position wayne rooney and numerous players well short of peak ability or tournament fitness in jordan henderson dele alli and eric dier in addition hodgson had a choice between danny drinkwater and jack wilshere on one hand drinkwater had just lifted the premier league title with leicester city forming a sensational midfield partnership alongside n golo kante providing creativity and passing range alongside the diminutive french battleship on the other wilshere had played a total of minutes of senior football in the whole of the season sidelined for much of the campaign with arsenal due to a fractured calf bone it was however wilshere who was rushed into action and who looked horrendously rusty during an hour of the dire goalless group stage draw with slovakia followed by minutes as a second half substitute against iceland in which he failed to spark england into life as they were humiliated and dumped out of the competition hodgson was pilloried for his blind faith in wilshere who until that point had been regarded as the future of england s midfield capable of moments of creative genius both for arsenal and his country shown in flashes between his serious injury absences euro was the moment that patience wore off for fans managers and pundits alike when it came to wilshere the last of his england caps was that nightmare in nice so we fast forward to where england have just played in their first major tournament final for years while wilshere has just been released from second tier bournemouth and at is at arguably the biggest crossroads of his career yet wilshere given the choice would turn around and proceed all the way back up the road he came back to arsenal his social media is full of comments on the gunners recent fortunes including a furious reaction to recent news of long serving coach steve bould s exit and he serves as a regular on arsenal focused podcasts and youtube panels he admitted in an interview with the guardian earlier this year that he regrets leaving the emirates stadium despite becoming less of a first team presence towards the end of his time there he said in march it s gone now that feeling that i could still be there i decided to leave whether it was right or wrong at the time it felt right and probably in hindsight it wasn t right but it is what it is i remember when i was a player and i ve got a lot of arsenal friends and family around me and i always remember them saying it s difficult to be an arsenal fan now i know what they mean now it is strange but i still feel like it is part of me sadly for wilshere that is not an option he is a free agent released from bournemouth after the six month deal he signed in january expired as new manager scott parker decided to go in a different direction wilshere despite not quite managing to inspire the cherries to a play off place leaves the vitality stadium with the respect of bournemouth intact he made appearances and in january managed to score his first senior goal since august the question now stands of where wilshere will go next having admitted when he first joined bournemouth that he had never seen himself playing outside the top tier i haven t played in the championship or tried to win promotion before if you had asked me years ago if this was something i thought i d ever be involved in i would have said no wilshere said in january he has proven he can still cut it at championship level when fit while there may also be options of a move to sunnier climes with wilshere having recently asking kieran gibbs seemingly tongue in cheek whether they need a new midfielder at inter miami the question though is whether wilshere wants to keep playing though his answer when joining bournemouth following three months as a free agent after being released by west ham suggests retirement is not an option quite yet i ve been lucky enough to earn good money throughout my career but being out of the game for three months made me realise i want to play this game for as long as possible he said earlier this year yet with an unreliable body continuous issues with his ankle and groin plus that cracked calf bone have caused him to miss an estimated club games throughout his career sheer enthusiasm can only last so long it is probable that we will see wilshere back on the field of play at some point in his reputation still strong enough for a club

after beating england on penalties having totally outplayed the three lions in the quarter finals italy faced germany in the semis where balotelli truly came alive he scored twice in the first half of a win germany s goal being a last minute consolation penalty the second goal was one of his most iconic riccardo montolivo lofted a simple ball over the sluggish german defence and balotelli confidence visibly surging through him took a touch and slammed the ball past manuel neuer he ripped off his shirt in celebration and glared at all around him this was his stage and he had performed this was the greatest night of my life and i hope sunday will be better balotelli said afterwards at the end of the game i went to my mother that was the best moment i told her these goals were for her i waited a long time for this moment especially as my mother is not young anymore and can t travel far so i had to make her happy when she came all the way here my father will be in kiev for the final too sunday was not better spain had ominously improved and crushed italy in the final for balotelli it was largely downhill from there fast forward eight and a half years and balotelli was joining serie b side monza in december he had been without a club since leaving brescia in july having repeatedly failed to turn up to training as they were relegated from serie a his travails at inter manchester city ac milan and liverpool among others are well documented from fireworks in the bathroom to scoring deliberate own goals in training he had been training with serie d club franciacorta when monza came calling balotelli penned a contract until the end of the season with an option to extend if monza earned promotion to the top flight for the first time in their year history it was the ninth club of his career signing with ambitious monza balotelli was reunited with former ac milan president silvio berlusconi and ceo adriano galliani now in charge at a club from a city far more associated with motor racing than football galliani claimed balotelli turned down a lucrative move to vasco da gama in brazil and agent mino raiola took no commission the forward joined monza when they were eighth in serie b after nine matches nine points off leaders salernitana but he was confident i thank the president berlusconi and adriano galliani for this opportunity he said i will do everything to help monza reach serie a galliani meanwhile made no bones about where balotelli was in his career and in being thrown a life raft by his former friends he told gazzetta dello sport i gave him a proper talking to and told him this is truly the last absolutely last completely the last chance i do love mario he s a player with the kind of technical and physical qualities that should ve allowed him do so much more with his career there were flashes of exceptional quality and i can t understand why he can t get even better after all he is only years old balotelli can be fundamental for monza raiola said his potential is undisputed but he is behind in his preparations and we will do everything we can to get him in top condition such pressure seemed primed to cause another balotelli explosion but he started extremely well scoring four minutes into his debut in a win over league leaders salernitana he turned in carlos augusto s cross with the first shot of the match and his first touch for his new team eventually monza finished third in serie b and entered the play offs as they aimed for back to back promotions however they exited to cittadella on aggregate unable to overturn a first leg deficit in the second match in his half season balotelli scored six goals and claimed one assist in games for monza a very respectable return his future is uncertain but exhibited proof there is still talent and hope off the pitch balotelli reportedly took a major pay cut from previous clubs lost weight and agreed to move close to monza to fit in with the team he is close with kevin prince boateng the pair regularly featuring in pictures on each others social media he also made a good impression with his other team mates fellow monza striker christian gytkjaer told the sportsman in march we ve created a great squad growing up you want to achieve things and play with great players and for sure boateng is one of them he s had a big career balotelli is another one i know there s been a lot of stories and stuff before but he s just a funny happy guy i have nothing bad to say about him he s just a good kid and a great guy to have around the dressing room the quality and experience these guys bring is helpful and brings us forward everyone is doing their part and i think we have a great future history suggests controversy and disarray will never be far

to supporters he had hardly ripped it up in serie a and while he had been part of the brazil side that reached the final of the under world cup he was by the time he moved to camp nou in professional football terms hardly a young prospect a clue may come in his fee douglas joined barca for million m m plus m m m in add ons he was a bargain buy to pad out luis enrique s squad douglas la liga debut for barcelona came against malaga and in a positive sense he kept a clean sheet in a draw on the other his personal performance was less than impressive reports at the time were unkind noting douglas was visibly lacking confidence and had notably negative body language the low point came when he picked up a booking for a needless tackle on malaga midfielder duda a year old with no turn of speed who had his back to goal douglas came charging in with a tackle that was weak and off balance giving away a free kick and earning a pointless booking it was the beginning of the end other aspects of his debut were equally poor full backs at barca are supposed to act as a supplementary attacking outlet especially against notably weaker opponents such as malaga yet in that game douglas passed the ball backwards times he was clearly not up to the required level and became barca s third choice right back behind dani alves and martin montoya and was restricted to making occasional copa del rey appearances and the odd cameo in other competitions in total across his first two seasons at barca before his loan adventures commenced douglas played in eight games for the club almost as many trophies as they earned during that period barca won the treble in began the subsequent campaign with the uefa super cup and in went on to claim the domestic double and the fifa club world cup while the silverware rained down for barca however douglas dream move turned nightmarish way out of his depth and suffering constant niggling injuries he had four separate spells on the treatment table in his first season there he admitted to as in a interview that he was frequently brought to tears he said in barcelona i had some tough times with injuries i d come home crying every day from year three onwards douglas was consigned to an eternal loan spiral away from barcelona although reports suggest he did not go without a fight he was after all a squad player in one of the greatest club sides ever with team mates including lionel messi xavi neymar and andres iniesta sport reported that he initially refused to sign the papers confirming his loan to sporting gijon and instead staged a sit down protest in the club s offices refusing to leave before eventually being coaxed into confirming the transfer at sporting he played regularly during their relegation campaign but there were reports he suffered a strange injury straining a muscle in his backside after falling asleep in an awkward position on the team coach douglas denied these claims in his as interview that wasn t right at all it was just an overstretched muscle and all it needed was a massage i was training the next day and it was written that i was injured when i wasn t that saddens me following his sporting stint he had months as a reserve at benfica before being key for sivasspor in his one year there eventually douglas left camp nou permanently for besiktas in the summer of after starting off in the first team

holiday break south korea international park joined arsenal from monaco towards the end of the summer transfer window in moving in a million m deal it appeared at first that manager arsene wenger had

interest from the gunners lille officials discovered that his hotel room was empty and having been given no notice of where he was going they were able to track him down at the eurostar terminal where park told them he was heading for england to sign for arsenal there were further questions about park s military service all able bodied south korean men must begin their service before the age of unless exempt meaning that arsenal faced losing park then for a significant period of time his move was initially welcomed in korea however and was endorsed by cho kwang rae the national team manager at the time he said he park will be playing many games in the premier league he will be able to grow into a better player it might be helpful for the national team there were immediate signs however that park had problems although he scored the winner in a league cup win over bolton wanderers his champions league debut for his new club in november proved to be a disaster park was badly off the pace in the goalless draw against marseille and was replaced after an hour with wenger commenting afterwards he did very well last week tonight you could see that he lacked the pace of the game a little bit because he has not played enough games not playing enough games was soon the theme of park s arsenal career in the season he appeared on only six occasions with only one of those coming in the premier league it would prove to be his only english league appearance the issue of military service had also reared its head though park managed to swerve this obligation by obtaining a year monaco residency visa from his time with the principality club it did not help his career at arsenal though while it also alienated supporters back home in korea who accused him of being unpatriotic park later apologised for his decision ultimately as a no park s early arsenal career was stymied by wenger s preferred formation into which he was thrown as a last minute signing with no english football experience and with little time to prepare this was also a side struggling badly to recapture the invincibles glory years with wenger s arsenal tenure well into its long slow decline with robin van persie converted from winger to central striker and taking to the role like a duck to water park was squeezed out wenger then re signed club legend thierry henry on loan in january while arrangements were made for germany star lukas podolski to sign in the summer park was now a forgotten man as evidenced in early august when podolski was handed the no shirt and park was bumped down to no loan spells away from arsenal followed he spent a season with celta vigo scoring just four goals in matches for a club that only avoided relegation from la liga by a single point he then returned to arsenal for a final attempt to make a mark of any description at the club he returned to the side in october making his first gunners appearance for months as an st minute substitute replacing aaron ramsey in the league cup against chelsea arsenal lost that game and those nine minutes represented park s only first team action of the campaign he never played for the club again park s career in european football also ended at that point as following his release in he spent the following season with saudi arabian side al shabab before returning to fc seoul in his homeland now park continues to represent seoul and is a highly respected figure in korean football capable of scoring some quite magnificent goals he has played at two world cups and also featured for korea at the london olympic games clearly a capable forward park is a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time and only having a reputation as one of the premier league s worst no s to show for it here

brazilian defender moved to camp nou in at the start of the club s greatest era but he never made a senior appearance for the blaugrana even the greatest football clubs in their finest eras have their flaws for pep guardiola s all conquering barcelona their achilles heel proved to be their transfer policy while some of the greatest players in the club s history such as xavi andres iniesta and lionel messi broke into the first team under the catalan coach they did so having come through the famed la masia academy system a total of players were signed from other teams during guardiola s reign and for every gem javier mascherano seydou keita or dani alves there was a dud aleksandr hleb martin caceres or dmytro chygrynskiy editors picks mamelodi sundowns sirino would price tag be a stumbling block for kaizer chiefs and orlando pirates romain emperor psg transfer target faivre ready for the big time has khune given kaizer chiefs coach baxter something to think about from title glory to a m divorce inside conte s tumultuous chelsea tenure the most baffling signing of them all however was henrique if you do not know who that is you can be forgiven as he never made a single appearance for the first team henrique signed for barcelona from palmeiras in for million m m as a fresh faced year old with a future as a commanding ball playing centre back seemingly in front of him being thrown straight into the barcelona first team having moved from south american football was never a likely option though so henrique was immediately sent out on loan to bayer leverkusen while henrique was away guardiola started to build one of the greatest club sides of all time immediately sealing the fate of the brazilian he would always be on the outside looking in in as henrique played for leverkusen barcelona won the treble the same summer as signing henrique barca had brought gerard pique back to the club from manchester united schooled at la masia and knowing exactly how guardiola wanted to play from the off pique slotted straight into guardiola s back line alongside veterans carles puyol and rafa marquez henrique did very little wrong at leverkusen he was an important first team player for the bundesliga outfit as they reached the dfb pokal final after his season in germany he told catalan daily newspaper sport that he felt he was ready for the step up to the barca fold i am feeling very well very happy i signed for barcelona a year ago and after a very positive experience at leverkusen i feel satisfied now i am resting but my head is per cent with barca he said i am looking forward to the discussions the club and my agent will have this week i am calm my desire is to be at barcelona on the th of july to begin pre season i believe that is very important for me because i want to join up with my barca team mates and let pep guardiola see what i can do this opportunity is fundamental to my career if barca decide to loan me out again i will accept their decision without any problems although i would prefer to play with a club in the spanish primera division guardiola however was less impressed with pique puyol and marquez so dominant he simply did not think the now year old brazilian was ready asked about henrique at a press conference in guardiola said playing as central defender at barcelona asks something different that s why i think there s no need to start criticising already but to give players the time they need to adapt there would be no time to adapt henrique spent the following two seasons on loan at fellow liga side racing santander where he lined up against messi and co that time spent in spanish football may have been enough to earn him a barcelona squad place eventually he did have a squad number no if it were not for the signing of mascherano for with guardiola s tiki taka style firmly established as the peak way to play the game at the time the coach could firmly lean into his beliefs of playing the ball out from the back when marquez was eased out of the first team midfielder mascherano slotted into the back line instead of a defender henrique was further away from the barca first team than ever before and was no longer a young prospect either in he was loaned back to palmeiras before being released the following summer as barca washed their hands of him he joined palmeiras on a permanent basis for a second time and spent most of his playing days back in his homeland now he has now made his way back into the european game with belenenses in portugal ultimately henrique was the victim of the flawed transfer strategy of barcelona chairman joan laporta part of this plan was to sign promising youngsters from markets such as south america for cheap loan them out to other european clubs and then sell them on for a profit after they impress this was also seen in forward keirrison signed from coritiba aged for m m m only to be farmed out on loan a remarkable five times in the hope of raising some extra cash in henrique s case leverkusen decided against signing him permanently despite his impressive year in germany he was good enough for second tier european competition qualifiers but not to break into the greatest club side of the modern era henrique got stuck in a perpetual loan cycle in and out of camp nou until his contract finally ran out left as a footnote in the history

italiana then and lift sanchez into the air will this victory inspire them to retain their serie a title we ll just have to find out that s all for now goodbye inter finished the game with shots to juve s eight so there can be no suggestion that they aren t worthy winners juve s players are understandably crestfallen they worked so hard to stay in the game and were seconds away from forcing the match to a penalty shootout instead they ll have to live with bitter defeat they may have to get used to not being italy s best team it s inter who ll lift the supercoppa for the sixth time the hosts totally deserve their victory having been the better side for the majority of the game juve may have snatched the lead early on and dug in after half time to force the game to extra time but they did little else inzaghi s men kept pushing though and sanchez s late winner will surely go down in inter folklore full time inter juventus aet m darmian assist darmian didn t mean that assist but how his teammates will thank him for it what s more there s no time for juve to respond that s the last kick of the game a s nchez goal goal inter juventus inter have won this supercoppa at the death juve fail to deal with a cross from inter s left darmian bravely flicks it down taking a whack in the process and sanchez bundles the ball into the bottom left corner from close range his teammates leap all over him at the corner flag a vidal yellow card mckennie cuts out inter s attack and vidal cannily races across to take out de sciglio the chilean accepts his deserved yellow card handanovic lumps clear under pressure and de sciglio rushes the ball out for an inter throw in inter perhaps have time for one more decent chance inter elect to keep possession rather than lose it and risk getting caught out it almost works in their favour as the ball comes loose to sanchez and perin smothers it juve take care of the ball for a while they soon lose possession and inter stream forward they ve played with more urgency all game yet they haven t been able to finish their visitors off perin punches inter s latest corner clear as de vrij challenges for it calhanoglu s effort from outside the box doesn t trouble the juve goalkeeper chance for inter sanchez switches the play for darmian who cuts the ball back from the right brozovic s blast towards goal is blocked and goes out for a corner the croatian shakes his head d rugani yellow card the referee s putting up with no nonsense now rugani tugs on correa s shirt as they race for the ball and gets booked for it j correa yellow card inter embark on their latest attack correa s booked for diving into a header dangerously in juve s box only more minutes remain of this game we re no closer to finding a winner yet but we will soon inter are beginning to look deflated while allegri gives his team a pep talk juve have had this game under wraps for the last hour or so they believe they can force this match to penalties at the very least there ll be one minute added onto this period brozovic s dinked cross from the right is met by the head of correa and caught by perin half time in extra time inter juventus p dybala yellow card juve s free kick doesn t lead to much dybala lands himself in the referee s book for handball inter pump another cross into juve s box to no avail juve break and bentancur is shouldered off the ball by brozovic juve get a free kick the quality of this game has dropped quite tragically since half time dybala lets fly from some way out he s nowhere near finding the target f dimarco i peri i inter substitution dimarco takes perisic s place at left wing back juve pop the ball around waiting for an opportunity to whistles from the home fans mckennie eventually clatters an ambitious shot from range into an inter defender inter are continuing to push for that second goal they lose out in midfield though now juve have possession inter come close to breaking the deadlock they win a corner down their left it comes in and sanchez heads wide it s unclear whether it would have stood had it found the target as skriniar and chiellini were tussling on the goalline and both ended up on the deck events on the pitch haven t been that entertaining since the end of the first half at least the crowd are keeping their spirits high they re making some racket in the stands we re underway again for more minutes who will win this year s supercoppa italiana r bentancur m locatelli before extra time gets underway juve make a change bentancur replaces locatelli in juve s midfield extra time it is then in this th supercoppa inter continue to look the more likely victors of this match but juve s defence has only looked more resolute as the match has gone on dumfries headed against the woodwork and martinez and perisic inspired saves from perin but that hasn t been enough for inter end of minutes inter juventus juve put together their first attack for a good while dybala smashes a shot against a defender on the edge of the box handanovic claims the follow up cross after giving mckennie an innocuous hand to the face inter get a throw in down their left and proceed to achieve nothing with it juve have well and truly shut this game down four more minutes of this await if neither side scores we re heading to extra time m darmian d dumfries dumfries goes off too his header against the post is the closest inter have come to scoring in the second half darmian replaces him at right wing back a vidal n barella inter make a few more changes too barella is the latest to go vidal comes on for him m kean morata juve replace their striker kean replaces morata who s worked hard but has been ineffectual going forward inter briefly draw juve out and manage to break through midfield as they did in the first half dumfries cross can t find anyone in black and blue though any late winner will have to wait dumfries plays a one two to reach the edge of the box but loses possession just as he s about to cross inter look out of ideas inter pass harmlessly around their backline and handanovic is forced to go long it works out in the hosts favour as they briefly get into juve s box before the visitors manage to shut the door it feels increasingly likely that this game will be heading to extra time inter were creating plenty of chances in the first half even if they weren t great ones now juve have tightened up and those chances have dried up arthur f bernardeschi juve make another substitution their main source of energy bernardeschi is tiring arthur replaces him in midfield dumfries sticks his head out for a cross in a similar way to his chance earlier this time he doesn t trouble perin juve s main man bernardeschi evades a few challenges before giving a free kick away alex sandro goes for goal from range and isn t too far from finding the bottom right corner bernardeschi skips over a challenge from brozovic but is muscled off the ball as he enters the box j correa e d eko dzeko also trots off correa takes his place up front for inter a s nchez lautaro mart nez inter look to refresh their forward line by replacing both their strikers martinez heads off first sanchez is his replacement p dybala d kulusevski juve make their first substitution of the match kulusevski creator of their opener makes way dybala comes on in his stead inter come close to grabbing the lead for the first time as perin is called into action again stopping perisic s drive from the centre of the box juve are playing a dangerous game the tempo of the game has slowed somewhat now that juve are dropping deeper max allegri s men are putting the pressure on inter to create something inter get a crossfield pass all wrong and juve take the throw in quickly they aren t able to get anywhere either inter are still creating the odd chance perisic hangs up a high cross from the left martinez gets on the end of it to force perin to make a save low to his right dzeko s cross from the byline is cut out kulusevski briefly looks able to break away down the right but inter are able to regroup and pass back to handanovic calhanoglu swings in the free kick juve get rid of it in a no nonsense fashion rugani s penalised for arriving late on martinez calhanoglu is standing over the free kick which will be from inter s left inter clear the corner dzeko goes up against chiellini and gets brought down by the juve captain inter get the free kick but this game is getting increasingly fractious juve earn another corner as bernardeschi whips the ball in and handanovic can t prevent a header back from going out of play this game could still swing either way mckennie slides into the attacking dumfries near juve s corner flag no free kick is given up the other end perisic plays it safe and nods a juve delivery out for a corner with bernardeschi lurking behind him e d eko yellow card dzeko picks up a yellow card for scything down bernardeschi near the touchline dumfries hits the post inter s dutch right wing back spots that calhanoglu is about to cross and dashes towards the back post the turk s ball comes in and dumfries powers a header against the upright perin is grateful to grab it at the second attempt juve s forwards are dropping deeper without the ball now making it harder for inter to charge past them in midfield bastoni s cutback from the byline is intercepted bastoni goes past perisic on the overlap and crosses in but no one s there perisic tries another cross and juve head the delivery away without difficulty dumfries has plenty of space to power into and fling a cross towards the box it floats harmlessly out for a throw in to juve morata s thankfully back to his feet bastoni thinks he s got the better of bernardeschi but is penalised for a high foot morata s down in agony after he goes into an aerial challenge with skriniar and the slovakian accidentally lands on his foot that looks painful inter are finding this half tougher than they did the first juve have looked the more motivated side since the break bernardeschi is trying to spur his team into action here he darts inside from the flank and flashes an effort just over the crossbar above handanovic s outstretched arm chance for juve bernardeschi drags his shot wide of the near post from the right of the box the winger found himself unmarked as a cross came to him from the left perisic s low cutback from the left evades everyone in the box juve clear juve get the second half going neither side has seen fit to make changes at half time inter had shots to juve s two in the first minutes here which goes to show how much inzaghi s men have dictated the play juve have done well to limit the quality of inter s chances though hence why they ve both only had two shots on target each inter should go on to win this if they can keep up their control of the game it s been an absorbing game so far one which inter have dominated despite the scoreline being level juve grabbed the lead against the run of play thanks to mckennie s header for the most part though the serie a champions have been the greater aggressors and deserved their equaliser from the spot via martinez more of this to come half time inter juventus inter get another corner as rabiot slides in to block perisic s cross cum shot it comes to nothing there ll be one added minute at the end of this first half f bernardeschi yellow card bernardeschi is furious not to get a free kick as he s swarmed by inter defenders he s booked for protesting too much inter have regrouped as we approach half time bastoni seeks out kulusevski s stray leg as he enters the box and flops to the turf the referee rightly ignores it inter force a few corners but are unsuccessful in testing perin martinez and dzeko combine to charge upfield they re lacking support though so dzeko waits for it brozovic tries to rattle the ball through a crowd of juve defenders to no avail juve head away inter s latest cross from the left now they can counter alex sandro jinks inside and attempts a crossfield pass only to get clipped by barella as he does so juve are awarded the free kick juve have another penalty appeal turned down as morata s dribble into the box is blocked off both teams are testing the officials eyesight here lautaro mart nez penalty goal goal inter juventus martinez steps up and smashes the penalty into the top right corner of the net leaving perin rooted to the spot that s a fine kick to level things up penalty for inter dzeko gets to perisic s clever backheel flick into the box and de sciglio clumsily brings the bosnian down the referee immediately points to the penalty spot calhanoglu allows perin to make a routine save as he fires off a gentle dipper from range martinez fires off target following dzeko s pass shortly after inter are understandably disappointed to be behind given their strong start calhanoglu is way off finding the target as he shoots first time from distance juve have grown in confidence having grabbed the opening goal handanovic dives low to keep out kulusevski s rasping shot from range assist kulusevski had plenty of time to pick his cross for mckennie there and the american properly planted his header where handanovic couldn t reach it this wasn t in inter s plan w mckennie goal goal inter juventus the away side take the lead in the supercoppa mckennie makes a great leap to nod kulusevski s cross into the far bottom corner from close range the swede had kept a cross alive just to the left of the box inter are frustrated as a free kick decision goes juve s way just as they re charging at the away side s defenders they ve been the better side early on but juve are easing into the game bernardeschi goes down to a challenge in inter s penalty area and smiles sheepishly knowing a penalty kick won t be awarded he s right juve are slowly improving morata feeds bernardeschi down the right and the winger rushes into the box to cross low for mckennie who s making a run towards the near post inter s defenders get stuck in and pressure morata into knocking the ball out of play bernardeschi crosses for his forwards from the left it curls away from handanovic s goal and away from danger for inter juve look very disjointed as a team their forwards are pressing inter high up the pitch while their defence is dropping deep it s giving inter plenty of space to drive into in midfield inter earn another corner as dzeko s effort from outside the box takes a deflection and rolls wide perin catches dzeko s resulting header after it s already drifted out of play for a goal kick inter have had five shots to juventus zero so far despite that juve have just edged possession inter are cutting through juve at the moment barella bursts onto a throughball into the box and gets barged off the ball by the covering chiellini the serie a champions want a penalty but the referee isn t interested juve have been warned seconds after having a shot blocked from outside the box martinez receives the ball closer to goal and skids an effort on the half volley wide of the right hand post inter are creating decent chances already they force alex sandro into conceding a corner down their right which calhanoglu swings in de vrij nods it towards goal under pressure and martinez is inches away from bundling it into the net at the far post instead the header bounces wide martinez is bundled over by locatelli down inter s right the hosts take their time to send the free kick in when it arrives it s a non event as juve clear it easily inter start the game on the front foot perisic darts inside from his left wing back position into the box the croatian curls a right footed cross towards dzeko who heads harmlessly over the crossbar from inside the box inter kick off to get the th supercoppa italiana underway the two teams are out on the pitch at a noisy san siro inter will play in their preferred black and blue home colours juve are wearing their famous black and white kit all is right with the world inter and juve have faced each other just once before in the supercoppa with inter lifting the trophy back in juve have lost just once in their last matches against inter although inter have a slightly better record recently when these two face off at san siro will inter win the supercoppa for the sixth time or will juve make it into double figures inter make two changes from their victory over lazio here three days ago calhanoglu and dzeko get the nod ahead of gagliardini and sanchez in

italiana then and lift sanchez into the air will this victory inspire them to retain their serie a title we ll just have to find out that s all for now goodbye inter finished the game with shots to juve s eight so there can be no suggestion that they aren t worthy winners juve s players are understandably crestfallen they worked so hard to stay in the game and were seconds away from forcing the match to a penalty shootout instead they ll have to live with bitter defeat they may have to get used to not being italy s best team it s inter who ll lift the supercoppa for the sixth time the hosts totally deserve their victory having been the better side for the majority of the game juve may have snatched the lead early on and dug in after half time to force the game to extra time but they did little else inzaghi s men kept pushing though and sanchez s late winner will surely go down in inter folklore full time inter juventus aet m darmian assist darmian didn t mean that assist but how his teammates will thank him for it what s more there s no time for juve to respond that s the last kick of the game a s nchez goal goal inter juventus inter have won this supercoppa at the death juve fail to deal with a cross from inter s left darmian bravely flicks it down taking a whack in the process and sanchez bundles the ball into the bottom left corner from close range his teammates leap all over him at the corner flag a vidal yellow card mckennie cuts out inter s attack and vidal cannily races across to take out de sciglio the chilean accepts his deserved yellow card handanovic lumps clear under pressure and de sciglio rushes the ball out for an inter throw in inter perhaps have time for one more decent chance inter elect to keep possession rather than lose it and risk getting caught out it almost works in their favour as the ball comes loose to sanchez and perin smothers it juve take care of the ball for a while they soon lose possession and inter stream forward they ve played with more urgency all game yet they haven t been able to finish their visitors off perin punches inter s latest corner clear as de vrij challenges for it calhanoglu s effort from outside the box doesn t trouble the juve goalkeeper chance for inter sanchez switches the play for darmian who cuts the ball back from the right brozovic s blast towards goal is blocked and goes out for a corner the croatian shakes his head d rugani yellow card the referee s putting up with no nonsense now rugani tugs on correa s shirt as they race for the ball and gets booked for it j correa yellow card inter embark on their latest attack correa s booked for diving into a header dangerously in juve s box only more minutes remain of this game we re no closer to finding a winner yet but we will soon inter are beginning to look deflated while allegri gives his team a pep talk juve have had this game under wraps for the last hour or so they believe they can force this match to penalties at the very least there ll be one minute added onto this period brozovic s dinked cross from the right is met by the head of correa and caught by perin half time in extra time inter juventus p dybala yellow card juve s free kick doesn t lead to much dybala lands himself in the referee s book for handball inter pump another cross into juve s box to no avail juve break and bentancur is shouldered off the ball by brozovic juve get a free kick the quality of this game has dropped quite tragically since half time dybala lets fly from some way out he s nowhere near finding the target f dimarco i peri i inter substitution dimarco takes perisic s place at left wing back juve pop the ball around waiting for an opportunity to whistles from the home fans mckennie eventually clatters an ambitious shot from range into an inter defender inter are continuing to push for that second goal they lose out in midfield though now juve have possession inter come close to breaking the deadlock they win a corner down their left it comes in and sanchez heads wide it s unclear whether it would have stood had it found the target as skriniar and chiellini were tussling on the goalline and both ended up on the deck events on the pitch haven t been that entertaining since the end of the first half at least the crowd are keeping their spirits high they re making some racket in the stands we re underway again for more minutes who will win this year s supercoppa italiana r bentancur m locatelli before extra time gets underway juve make a change bentancur replaces locatelli in juve s midfield extra time it is then in this th supercoppa inter continue to look the more likely victors of this match but juve s defence has only looked more resolute as the match has gone on dumfries headed against the woodwork and martinez and perisic inspired saves from perin but that hasn t been enough for inter end of minutes inter juventus juve put together their first attack for a good while dybala smashes a shot against a defender on the edge of the box handanovic claims the follow up cross after giving mckennie an innocuous hand to the face inter get a throw in down their left and proceed to achieve nothing with it juve have well and truly shut this game down four more minutes of this await if neither side scores we re heading to extra time m darmian d dumfries dumfries goes off too his header against the post is the closest inter have come to scoring in the second half darmian replaces him at right wing back a vidal n barella inter make a few more changes too barella is the latest to go vidal comes on for him m kean morata juve replace their striker kean replaces morata who s worked hard but has been ineffectual going forward inter briefly draw juve out and manage to break through midfield as they did in the first half dumfries cross can t find anyone in black and blue though any late winner will have to wait dumfries plays a one two to reach the edge of the box but loses possession just as he s about to cross inter look out of ideas inter pass harmlessly around their backline and handanovic is forced to go long it works out in the hosts favour as they briefly get into juve s box before the visitors manage to shut the door it feels increasingly likely that this game will be heading to extra time inter were creating plenty of chances in the first half even if they weren t great ones now juve have tightened up and those chances have dried up arthur f bernardeschi juve make another substitution their main source of energy bernardeschi is tiring arthur replaces him in midfield dumfries sticks his head out for a cross in a similar way to his chance earlier this time he doesn t trouble perin juve s main man bernardeschi evades a few challenges before giving a free kick away alex sandro goes for goal from range and isn t too far from finding the bottom right corner bernardeschi skips over a challenge from brozovic but is muscled off the ball as he enters the box j correa e d eko dzeko also trots off correa takes his place up front for inter a s nchez lautaro mart nez inter look to refresh their forward line by replacing both their strikers martinez heads off first sanchez is his replacement p dybala d kulusevski juve make their first substitution of the match kulusevski creator of their opener makes way dybala comes on in his stead inter come close to grabbing the lead for the first time as perin is called into action again stopping perisic s drive from the centre of the box juve are playing a dangerous game the tempo of the game has slowed somewhat now that juve are dropping deeper max allegri s men are putting the pressure on inter to create something inter get a crossfield pass all wrong and juve take the throw in quickly they aren t able to get anywhere either inter are still creating the odd chance perisic hangs up a high cross from the left martinez gets on the end of it to force perin to make a save low to his right dzeko s cross from the byline is cut out kulusevski briefly looks able to break away down the right but inter are able to regroup and pass back to handanovic calhanoglu swings in the free kick juve get rid of it in a no nonsense fashion rugani s penalised for arriving late on martinez calhanoglu is standing over the free kick which will be from inter s left inter clear the corner dzeko goes up against chiellini and gets brought down by the juve captain inter get the free kick but this game is getting increasingly fractious juve earn another corner as bernardeschi whips the ball in and handanovic can t prevent a header back from going out of play this game could still swing either way mckennie slides into the attacking dumfries near juve s corner flag no free kick is given up the other end perisic plays it safe and nods a juve delivery out for a corner with bernardeschi lurking behind him e d eko yellow card dzeko picks up a yellow card for scything down bernardeschi near the touchline dumfries hits the post inter s dutch right wing back spots that calhanoglu is about to cross and dashes towards the back post the turk s ball comes in and dumfries powers a header against the upright perin is grateful to grab it at the second attempt juve s forwards are dropping deeper without the ball now making it harder for inter to charge past them in midfield bastoni s cutback from the byline is intercepted bastoni goes past perisic on the overlap and crosses in but no one s there perisic tries another cross and juve head the delivery away without difficulty dumfries has plenty of space to power into and fling a cross towards the box it floats harmlessly out for a throw in to juve morata s thankfully back to his feet bastoni thinks he s got the better of bernardeschi but is penalised for a high foot morata s down in agony after he goes into an aerial challenge with skriniar and the slovakian accidentally lands on his foot that looks painful inter are finding this half tougher than they did the first juve have looked the more motivated side since the break bernardeschi is trying to spur his team into action here he darts inside from the flank and flashes an effort just over the crossbar above handanovic s outstretched arm chance for juve bernardeschi drags his shot wide of the near post from the right of the box the winger found himself unmarked as a cross came to him from the left perisic s low cutback from the left evades everyone in the box juve clear juve get the second half going neither side has seen fit to make changes at half time inter had shots to juve s two in the first minutes here which goes to show how much inzaghi s men have dictated the play juve have done well to limit the quality of inter s chances though hence why they ve both only had two shots on target each inter should go on to win this if they can keep up their control of the game it s been an absorbing game so far one which inter have dominated despite the scoreline being level juve grabbed the lead against the run of play thanks to mckennie s header for the most part though the serie a champions have been the greater aggressors and deserved their equaliser from the spot via martinez more of this to come half time inter juventus inter get another corner as rabiot slides in to block perisic s cross cum shot it comes to nothing there ll be one added minute at the end of this first half f bernardeschi yellow card bernardeschi is furious not to get a free kick as he s swarmed by inter defenders he s booked for protesting too much inter have regrouped as we approach half time bastoni seeks out kulusevski s stray leg as he enters the box and flops to the turf the referee rightly ignores it inter force a few corners but are unsuccessful in testing perin martinez and dzeko combine to charge upfield they re lacking support though so dzeko waits for it brozovic tries to rattle the ball through a crowd of juve defenders to no avail juve head away inter s latest cross from the left now they can counter alex sandro jinks inside and attempts a crossfield pass only to get clipped by barella as he does so juve are awarded the free kick juve have another penalty appeal turned down as morata s dribble into the box is blocked off both teams are testing the officials eyesight here lautaro mart nez penalty goal goal inter juventus martinez steps up and smashes the penalty into the top right corner of the net leaving perin rooted to the spot that s a fine kick to level things up penalty for inter dzeko gets to perisic s clever backheel flick into the box and de sciglio clumsily brings the bosnian down the referee immediately points to the penalty spot calhanoglu allows perin to make a routine save as he fires off a gentle dipper from range martinez fires off target following dzeko s pass shortly after inter are understandably disappointed to be behind given their strong start calhanoglu is way off finding the target as he shoots first time from distance juve have grown in confidence having grabbed the opening goal handanovic dives low to keep out kulusevski s rasping shot from range assist kulusevski had plenty of time to pick his cross for mckennie there and the american properly planted his header where handanovic couldn t reach it this wasn t in inter s plan w mckennie goal goal inter juventus the away side take the lead in the supercoppa mckennie makes a great leap to nod kulusevski s cross into the far bottom corner from close range the swede had kept a cross alive just to the left of the box inter are frustrated as a free kick decision goes juve s way just as they re charging at the away side s defenders they ve been the better side early on but juve are easing into the game bernardeschi goes down to a challenge in inter s penalty area and smiles sheepishly knowing a penalty kick won t be awarded he s right juve are slowly improving morata feeds bernardeschi down the right and the winger rushes into the box to cross low for mckennie who s making a run towards the near post inter s defenders get stuck in and pressure morata into knocking the ball out of play bernardeschi crosses for his forwards from the left it curls away from handanovic s goal and away from danger for inter juve look very disjointed as a team their forwards are pressing inter high up the pitch while their defence is dropping deep it s giving inter plenty of space to drive into in midfield inter earn another corner as dzeko s effort from outside the box takes a deflection and rolls wide perin catches dzeko s resulting header after it s already drifted out of play for a goal kick inter have had five shots to juventus zero so far despite that juve have just edged possession inter are cutting through juve at the moment barella bursts onto a throughball into the box and gets barged off the ball by the covering chiellini the serie a champions want a penalty but the referee isn t interested juve have been warned seconds after having a shot blocked from outside the box martinez receives the ball closer to goal and skids an effort on the half volley wide of the right hand post inter are creating decent chances already they force alex sandro into conceding a corner down their right which calhanoglu swings in de vrij nods it towards goal under pressure and martinez is inches away from bundling it into the net at the far post instead the header bounces wide martinez is bundled over by locatelli down inter s right the hosts take their time to send the free kick in when it arrives it s a non event as juve clear it easily inter start the game on the front foot perisic darts inside from his left wing back position into the box the croatian curls a right footed cross towards dzeko who heads harmlessly over the crossbar from inside the box inter kick off to get the th supercoppa italiana underway the two teams are out on the pitch at a noisy san siro inter will play in their preferred black and blue home colours juve are wearing their famous black and white kit all is right with the world inter and juve have faced each other just once before in the supercoppa with inter lifting the trophy back in juve have lost just once in their last matches against inter although inter have a slightly better record recently when these two face off at san siro will inter win the supercoppa for the sixth time or will juve make it into double figures inter make two changes from their victory over lazio here three days ago calhanoglu and dzeko get the nod ahead of gagliardini and sanchez in

tumultuous chelsea tenure i played against lazio on sunday so i thought i would have started tonight because i was in good shape but the coach made his decision sanchez has long had an issue with his coach s decisions at inter it was former boss antonio conte who had offered him a way out of his manchester united nightmare but sanchez quickly grew frustrated with being asked to play the role of super sub conte used to say to me that there was nobody else like me and that i had to make the difference in the final minutes he explained i told him that by doing that he was making me suffer i said put me on earlier i can make the difference then too view this post on instagram sanchez initially found minutes even harder to come by under conte s successor simone inzaghi and after being left on the bench for the entirety of a win over sassuolo on october he snapped the former arsenal ace took to instagram shortly after the game and posted a picture of a sand covered lamborghini deserted at the side of a road you can be worth a lot sanchez wrote but if you re not in the right place you cannot shine the message was clear sanchez wasn t happy at inter and wanted out a january exit looked inevitable at that point given nerazzurri ceo beppe marotta was more than happy to let him leave after all cash strapped inter were effectively paying sanchez million m m to sit on the bench every week alexis sanchez polemico dopo la panchina col sassuolo posta su instagram una ferrari abbandonata e impolverata e scrive puoi valere molto per se non sei nel posto giusto non puoi brillare inter pic twitter com gdrjswdum simone togna october the situation has now changed slightly though marotta remains open to sanchez s exit either before the close of the january transfer window or at the end of the season when inter have the option to buy out the final year of the player s contract for m m m inzaghi would now favour the latter scenario as he believes that sanchez has shown that he can play a pivotal role in the second half of the campaign back in october sanchez was playing more regularly for his country than his club however inzaghi has been impressed with the year old s application since the instagram outburst sanchez has featured in inter s last six serie a outings starting three of them and scoring twice he s been very good the inter boss told dazn after last month s win over cagliari he s a great professional he works well during the week and he tries to show me in every training session that he wants more game time when i ve called him in the past he s always given great responses everyone knows alexis value he can win a game for you from one moment to the next he did exactly that against juve pouncing on a loose ball in the juve area to earn inter a first supercoppa success since in the grand scheme of things it s not a very meaningful trophy wednesday night felt different though the gazzetta dello sport felt that the result proved that inter s cycle of success had truly begun the nerazzurri dethroned juventus as the champions of italy last summer and now they ve taken their supercoppa trophy too defeat certainly hit the old lady hard juventus centre back leonardo bonucci even got into a touchline row with inter secretary cristiano mozzillo inter meanwhile were ecstatic with marotta making his way down to the pitch at full time to share a warm embrace with inzaghi whom he shrewdly hired to replace conte last summer the victory though meant even more to sanchez who stood bare chested before the inter fans during the post match celebrations i ve been a caged lion he claimed if they let me play i ll become a monster alexis sanchez waited a long time for a moment like this pic twitter com fpzaopvjsc goal january the return of the alexis sanchez of old would certainly represent a terrifying proposition for inter s rivals given the league leaders already boast lautaro martinez and edin dzeko in attack the key question though is whether he can stay fit he s suffered numerous injuries over the past two and a half years which has severely hindered his ability to build up any momentum and partially explains why he has started just of the games he s featured in for inter as inzaghi has noted his work rate certainly can t be questioned sanchez has always looked after himself in terms of training and diet even back in his udinese days he would often leave his car at the club s training ground and make the kilometre walk home on foot and even when he goes on holiday he never goes more than two days without hitting the gym all of this explains why sanchez at the age of remains in impressive physical condition as he was so keen to underline on wednesday night he took off his jersey after scoring the winner out of pure joy but he then removed his performance shirt to show that he is as strong as he s ever been if he is to usurp lautaro or dzeko up front the onus is now on sanchez to prove that he can deliver this kind of decisive display on a consistent basis after his supercoppa strike he declared this is the roar of the lion making it clear that he wants to be set free inter may well grant him his wish it s just not yet certain whether that means letting him loose on serie a defences on a weekly basis or finding a new home for him elsewhere contact us terms of service privacy policy copyright goal

barcelona forward s arrival and the club s social media team pulled out all the stops with the announcement it was the biggest united post on instagram with two million likes and comments the most shared united facebook post ever the most retweeted post ever and alexis was the number one trending topic on twitter worldwide ed woodward bragged about sanchez s signing the video which shows the attacker playing the piano to the tune of glory glory man united went viral job done while united s board could pat themselves on the back for signing a player who generated per cent more interactions than when neymar arrived at paris saint germain from barcelona and had broken the shirt sales record for a player signed in january the bleak reality was that the second video was the most lucrative act he ever produced for the club after a handful of good performances and five goals in appearances sanchez s united career is over he struggled from the outset for the red devils with fans and pundits perplexed as to what had happened to a player that had consistently lit up the premier league in north london this was not the sought after attacker coveted by many who had been imperious for barcelona and arsenal he was unrecognisable burnout was cited as a reason for sanchez s decline after numerous international tournament appearances so surely a summer off would allow him to get back to the levels which saw him named arsenal s player of the season just eight months before his arrival at old trafford jose mourinho backed the forward during the club s pre season tour ahead of the campaign and there was a faint hope that his first full season at the club would iron out the issues that was not the case gary neville referred to him as a disaster with sanchez cutting a sullen and frustrated figure as he continued to struggle to rediscover his best form meanwhile his arrival also had a knock on effect on the morale of his team mates anthony martial was irritated at being played out of position to accommodate sanchez while there were well publicised issues regarding his a week salary united s wage structure had been ripped apart with it ultimately leading to the departure of ander herrera in the summer of and an enormous new deal for david de gea to ensure he did not follow his fellow spaniard out the exit doors pep guardiola to his credit had warned that such problems would arise manchester city had been favourites to land sanchez before united swooped in and still believe he would have preferred to join them they would not however agree to the financial demands of the deal they dodged a bullet normally we try to be stable with the wages of the players because i think it is good for the team and stability of the club guardiola said i ve never put pressure on a club when they believe it is too much immediately i accept that decision and move forward to find another solution the stability of the club is the most important thing guardiola s observations rang true at old trafford herrera s demands of a wage increase in the wake of sanchez s deal led to him departing for psg and the club are still trying to rectify the issue now as the chilean finally departs it is understood that the problems with the wage structure mean that they will not be rushed into agreeing terms with this summer s primary transfer target jadon sancho united do not want to upset the current balance and set a new precedent within the dressing room by offering the year old over the odds some believe that the pressure of living up to such a huge salary was too much for sanchez to deal with and that it affected his performances it is also true that he never really settled in manchester he was an isolated individual both inside and outside of the dressing room seeking solace with his dogs atom and humber sanchez s most notable companion at the club was romelu lukaku with whom he struck up a close bond that has continued after both moved to inter at the start of the season sanchez has however continued to be a drain on united s finances even while on loan with the club footing of his weekly wage
there were times during the campaign when it looked like united would be stuck with paying sanchez s entire salary until the end of his contract in june with the out of form year old heading toward the twilight years of his career ole gunnar solskjaer toed the party line by insisting that sanchez would be part of his plans upon his return but that was never the case sanchez goes against everything that solskjaer is trying to do in rebuilding this united team put bluntly he is too old and would be a destabilising presence in the dressing room fortunately for united since the coronavirus enforced break in football sanchez has rediscovered something closer to his best form under antonio conte and inter see him as a key part of their team going forward that has offered united a lifeline even though it means tearing up the contract they have with sanchez united will not receive a fee from inter and will have to pay sanchez a settlement of their own but it is still good business now the club can finally draw a line under one of if not the most disappointing signings in its history the nightmare is over for all involved and with one no heading for the exits without fanfare attentions can firmly turn to bringing their next no in sancho through the front door contact us terms of service privacy policy copyright goal south africa all rights reserved the information contained in goal south africa may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed without the prior written authority of goal south africa ","sanchez,wage,club,inter,nightmare,alexis,old,dressing,salary,deal"
