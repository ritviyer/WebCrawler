<p>The Chile international's permanent move to Inter was confirmed on&nbsp;Thursday, <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-za/news/inter-sign-man-utd-flop-sanchez-on-free-transfer/virg94ae71d116q7pj0d008n3" target="_blank">with Sanchez signing a three-year deal at San Siro</a> following his season-long loan spell in Milan.</p>
<p>It is perhaps befitting of his time at United that the biggest impact Sanchez&nbsp;had on the Old Trafford pitch was before he had even kicked a ball.</p><div class="widget-inline-editors-picks clearfix"> <h3>Editors&#039; Picks</h3> <ul>  <li> <a href="/en-za/news/mamelodi-sundowns-sirino-would-price-tag-be-a-stumbling/blt7739497b242d34dc" title="Mamelodi Sundowns&#039; Sirino: Would price-tag be a stumbling block for Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates?"> Mamelodi Sundowns&#039; Sirino: Would price-tag be a stumbling block for Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates? </a> </li>  <li> <a href="/en-za/news/psg-transfer-target-faivre/blt4c3a2236074a03f5" title="Romain emperor: PSG transfer target Faivre ready for the big time"> Romain emperor: PSG transfer target Faivre ready for the big time </a> </li>  <li> <a href="/en-za/news/has-khune-given-kaizer-chiefs-coach-baxter-something-to/blt44d7077b8fd4ce3c" title="Has Khune given Kaizer Chiefs coach Baxter something to think about?"> Has Khune given Kaizer Chiefs coach Baxter something to think about? </a> </li>  <li> <a href="/en-za/news/from-title-glory-to-bitter-divorce-conte-chelsea-tenure/bltf29875efd62af620" title="From title glory to a Â£26m divorce: Inside Conte&#039;s tumultuous Chelsea tenure"> From title glory to a Â£26m divorce: Inside Conte&#039;s tumultuous Chelsea tenure </a> </li>  </ul> </div>
<p>Under the spotlights of the Stretford End in January 2018, the new signing from Arsenal was ushered into his new home&nbsp;to film his unveiling. Fans had been patiently waiting for official confirmation of the former Barcelona forwardâs arrival, and the clubâs social media team pulled out all the stops with the announcement.</p>
<p>"It was the biggest United post on Instagram with two million likes and comments, the most shared United Facebook post ever, the most retweeted post ever and #Alexis7 was the number one trending topic on Twitter worldwide,â Ed Woodward bragged&nbsp;about Sanchezâs signing.</p>
<p>The video, which shows the attacker playing the piano to the tune of 'Glory Glory Man United', went viral. Job done.</p>
<p>While Unitedâs board could pat themselves on the back for signing a player who generated 75 per cent&nbsp;more interactions than when Neymar arrived at Paris Saint-Germain from Barcelona and had broken the shirt sales record for a player signed in January, the bleak reality was that the 55-second video was the most lucrative act&nbsp;he ever produced for the club.</p>
<p>After a handful of good performances and five goals in 45 appearances, Sanchez's United career is over.</p>
<p>He&nbsp;struggled from the outset for the Red Devils, with fans and pundits perplexed as to what had happened to a player that had consistently lit up the Premier League in north London.</p>
<p>This was not&nbsp;the sought-after attacker coveted by many&nbsp;who had been imperious for Barcelona and Arsenal. He was unrecognisable.</p>
<p>Burnout was cited&nbsp;as a reason for Sanchezâs decline after numerous international tournament appearances,&nbsp;so surely a summer off would allow him to get back to the levels which saw him named Arsenalâs Player of the Season just eight months before his arrival at Old Trafford?</p>
<p>Jose Mourinho backed the forward during the clubâs pre-season tour ahead of the 2018-19 campaign, and there was a faint hope that his first full season at the club would iron out the issues. That was not&nbsp;the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<div class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/blt6989ed905925855d/60db472efd14d30f3eac92ba/380d9050edb6970deb1f0d18049dd3feaba1a2dd.png?quality=60&width=190" alt="" /></div><p></p>
<p>Gary Neville referred to him as a "disaster", with&nbsp;Sanchez cutting a sullen and frustrated figure as he continued to struggle to rediscover his best form.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his arrival also had a knock-on effect on the morale of his team-mates. Anthony Martial was irritated at being played out of position to accommodate Sanchez while there&nbsp;were well-publicised&nbsp;issues regarding his&nbsp;Â£560,000-a-week salary.</p>
<p>United's wage structure had been ripped apart, with it&nbsp;ultimately leading&nbsp;to the departure of Ander Herrera in the summer of 2019&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-za/news/de-gea-signs-new-four-year-deal-with-man-utd/1wb5qhvkx6bqr1kwyybzxulgky" target="_blank">an enormous new deal for&nbsp;David de Gea</a> to ensure he did not follow his fellow Spaniard out the exit doors.</p>
<p>Pep Guardiola, to his credit, had warned that&nbsp;such problems would arise. Manchester City had been favourites to land Sanchez before United swooped in, and still believe he would have preferred to join them.</p>
<p>They would not, however, agree to the financial demands of the deal. They dodged a bullet.</p>
<p>âNormally we try to be stable with the wages of the players because I think it is good for the team and stability of the club,â Guardiola said. âIâve never put pressure on a club when they believe it is too much. Immediately I accept that decision and move forward to find another solution. The stability of the club is the most important thing.â</p>
<p>Guardiolaâs observations rang true at Old Trafford. <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-za/news/herreras-350000-wage-demands-led-to-man-utd-exit/s8e9vntd5ayg171nkfczic8hc" target="_blank">Herreraâs demands of a wage increase&nbsp;in the wake of Sanchezâs deal led to him departing for&nbsp;PSG</a>, and the club are still trying to rectify the issue now as the Chilean finally departs.</p>
<p>It is understood that the problems with the wage structure mean that they&nbsp;will not be rushed into agreeing terms with this summer's primary&nbsp;transfer target, Jadon Sancho. United do not want to upset the current balance&nbsp;and set a new precedent within the dressing room&nbsp;by offering the 20-year-old over the odds.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/blt286092336549757a/60dc15d5ed93bb0fb19b36b6/9a26b71431614f1aaf607d98d77d3b0595969cfd.jpg?quality=60&width=190" alt="" /></div><p></p>
<p>Some believe that the&nbsp;pressure of living up to such a huge salary&nbsp;was too much for Sanchez to deal with&nbsp;and that it affected his performances.</p>
<p>It is also true that he never really settled in Manchester. He was an isolated individual&nbsp;both inside and outside of the dressing room,&nbsp;seeking solace with his dogs Atom and Humber.</p>
<p>Sanchez's most notable companion at the club was Romelu Lukaku, with whom he struck up a close bond&nbsp;that has continued after both moved to Inter at the start of the 2019-20 season.</p>
<p>Sanchez has, however,&nbsp;continued to be a drain on Unitedâs finances even while on loan, with the club footing Â£175,000 of his weekly wage</p>
<p>There were times during the campaign&nbsp;when it looked like United would be stuck with paying Sanchez's entire salary&nbsp;until the end of his contract in June 2022, with the out-of-form 31-year-old heading toward&nbsp;the twilight years of his career.</p>
<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer toed the party line by insisting that Sanchez would be part of his plans upon his return, but that was never the case.</p>
<p>Sanchez goes against everything that Solskjaer is trying to do in rebuilding this United&nbsp;team. Put bluntly, he is&nbsp;too old and would be a destabilising presence in the dressing room.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately for United, <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-za/news/sanchez-renaissance-offers-man-utd-hope-of-selling-inter/wyqimzlef3zn1coxe5hgog2bd" target="_blank">since the coronavirus-enforced break in football Sanchez&nbsp;has rediscovered something closer to his best form under Antonio Conte,</a> and&nbsp;Inter see him as a key part of their team going forward.</p>
<p>That has offered United a lifeline,&nbsp;even though it means tearing up the contract they have with Sanchez. United will not receive a fee from Inter and will have to pay Sanchez a settlement of their own, but it is still good business.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/blt3dc53b0fb21fa3b4/60db44b3f1ff900f4d3e340a/fef0de4d0044b121985ea7d91addd68674df2dec.jpg?quality=60&width=190" alt="" /></div><p></p>
<p>Now the club can finally draw a line under one of, if not the most disappointing signings in its history.</p>
<p>The nightmare is over for all involved, and with one No.7 heading for the exits without&nbsp;fanfare, attentions can firmly turn to bringing their next No.7 in Sancho&nbsp;through the front door.</p> </div>  </div> </div>  </div> <div class="widget-footer"> <a href="/en-za" class="widget-footer__logo"> <img src="/assets/low-end/ltr/img/logo/light-lowend-header.d1d7448b47.png" alt="GOAL.com" /> </a> <div class="widget-footer__links">  <div><a href="/en-za/contact">Contact Us</a></div> <div><a href="/en-za/legal/terms-conditions">Terms of Service</a></div> <div><a href="/en-za/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a></div>  </div> <p class="widget-footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2022 <a href="/en-za">Goal (South Africa)</a> All rights reserved.
