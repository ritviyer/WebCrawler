<p>His prolonged absence from the first-team picture makes Ozil look like he is merely taking a Bank Holiday break.</p>
<p>South Korea&nbsp;international Park joined Arsenal from Monaco towards the end of the summer transfer window in 2011, moving in a Â£3 million ($4m) deal.</p>
<p>It appeared at first that manager Arsene Wenger had pulled off quite the coup, stealing Park from under the noses of Ligue 1 side Lille after the forward&nbsp;walked out of a hotel room while waiting for a medical with the French outfit&nbsp;having been informed&nbsp;of interest from the Gunners.</p>
<p>Lille officials discovered that his hotel room was empty&nbsp;and, having been given no notice of where he was going, they were able to track&nbsp;him down at the Eurostar terminal, where Park told them he was heading for England to sign for Arsenal.</p>
<p>There were further questions about Parkâs military service -&nbsp;all able-bodied South Korean men must begin their service before the age of 28 unless exempt - meaning that Arsenal faced losing Park, then 26, for a significant period of time.</p>
<p>His move was initially welcomed in Korea however, <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-za/news/2896/premier-league/2011/08/29/2641373/i-wont-regret-joining-arsenal-south-korea-captain-park-chu-young-" target="_blank"> and was endorsed by Cho Kwang-rae, the national team manager at the time. </a></p>
<p>He said: "He [Park] will be playing many games in the Premier League, he will be able to grow into a better player. It might be helpful for the national team."</p>
<p></p>
<div class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/blte7475774b7a02e07/60db075c2e95e10f21eecd6a/195344918ee0d750381af6fb3f6d4d67383d137d.jpg?quality=60&width=190" alt="" /></div><p></p>
<p>There were immediate signs, however, that Park had problems. Although he scored the winner in a 2-1 League Cup win over Bolton Wanderers, his Champions League debut for his new club&nbsp;in November 2011 proved to be a disaster.</p>
<p>Park was badly off the pace in the goalless draw against Marseille, and&nbsp;was replaced after an hour, <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-za/news/2914/champions-league/2011/11/02/2739102/arsenal-boss-arsene-wenger-says-park-chu-young-lacked-pace" target="_blank"> with Wenger commenting afterwards:</a>&nbsp;"He did very well last week. Tonight you could see that he lacked the pace of the game a little bit because he has not played enough games.â</p>
<p>Not playing enough games was soon the theme of Parkâs Arsenal career. In the 2011-12 season, he appeared on only six occasions, with only one of those coming in the Premier League. It would prove to&nbsp;be his only English league appearance.</p>
<p>The issue of military service had also reared its head, though Park managed to swerve this obligation&nbsp;by obtaining a 10-year Monaco residency visa from his time with the principality club.</p>
<p>It did not help his career at Arsenal though, while it also alienated supporters back home in Korea, who accused him of being unpatriotic. <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-za/news/3800/korea/2012/06/13/3169505/arsenals-park-chu-young-apologises-for-military-service-saga" target="_blank"> Park later apologised for his decision. </a></p>
<p>Ultimately, as a No.9, Parkâs early Arsenal career was stymied by Wengerâs preferred 4-5-1 / 4-3-3 formation, into which he was thrown as a last-minute signing with no English football experience&nbsp;and with little time to prepare.</p>
<p>This was also a&nbsp;side struggling badly to recapture the 'Invincibles' glory years, with&nbsp;Wengerâs Arsenal tenure&nbsp;well into its long, slow decline.</p>
<p>With Robin van Persie converted from winger to central striker and taking to the role like a duck to water, Park was squeezed out.</p>
<p>Wenger then re-signed club legend Thierry Henry on loan in January 2012, while arrangements were made for Germany star Lukas Podolski to sign in the summer. Park was now a forgotten man â as evidenced in early August&nbsp;when Podolski&nbsp;was handed the No.9 shirt and&nbsp;Park was bumped down to No.30.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/blta9e81ef080a6c44a/60db08b45543520fcbbfeefe/a4acb85863ee17520051284c47784826d8e3ef7c.jpg?quality=60&width=190" alt="" /></div><p></p>
<p>Loan spells away from Arsenal followed. He spent a season with Celta Vigo, scoring just four goals in 26 matches for a club that only avoided relegation from La Liga by a single point.</p>
<p>He then&nbsp;returned to Arsenal for 2013-14 - a final attempt to make a mark of any description at the club.</p>
<p>He returned to the side in October 2013, making his first Gunners appearance for 14 months as an 81st-minute substitute, replacing Aaron Ramsey in the League Cup against Chelsea.</p>
<p>Arsenal lost that game 2-0, and those nine minutes represented Parkâs only first-team action of the campaign. He never played for the club again.</p>
<p>Parkâs career in European football also ended at that point as, following his release in 2014,&nbsp;he spent the following season with Saudi Arabian side Al-Shabab before returning to FC Seoul in his homeland.</p>
<p>Now 35, Park continues to represent Seoul and is a highly respected figure in Korean football, <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-za/news/video-former-arsenal-forward-park-scores-stunning-free-kick/1szmchelarvoh1e4aidl80jm1t" target="_blank"> capable of scoring some quite magnificent goals. </a></p>
<p>He has played at two World Cups and also featured for Korea at the London 2012 Olympic Games.</p>
<p>Clearly a capable forward, Park is a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and only having a reputation as one of the Premier Leagueâs worst No.9s to show for it.</p>
