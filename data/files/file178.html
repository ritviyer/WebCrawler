<p>Abdul Fatawu Issahaku certainly marked the occasion of his first Black Stars appearanceâalbeit for Ghanaâs 'B' teamâin a fashion that perfectly demonstrated&nbsp;the confidence, swagger and panache with which his emergence has been typified.</p>
<p>Issahaku had previously drawn parallels with fellow Tamale native and Ghana great Abedi Pele before his assured debut, and had already bewitched the hostsâ defenders with his movement and dribbling skills before - in the 71st&nbsp;minute - taking responsibility for a free-kick, 35&nbsp;yards from goal, as Ghana sought an equaliser.</p><div class="widget-inline-editors-picks clearfix"> <h3>Editors&#039; Picks</h3> <ul>  <li> <a href="/en-us/news/from-title-glory-to-bitter-divorce-conte-chelsea-tenure/bltf29875efd62af620" title="From title glory to a Â£26m divorce: Inside Conte&#039;s tumultuous Chelsea tenure"> From title glory to a Â£26m divorce: Inside Conte&#039;s tumultuous Chelsea tenure </a> </li>  <li> <a href="/en-us/news/psg-transfer-target-faivre/blt4c3a2236074a03f5" title="Romain emperor: PSG transfer target Faivre ready for the big time"> Romain emperor: PSG transfer target Faivre ready for the big time </a> </li>  <li> <a href="/en-us/news/rafael-leao-new-henry-ibrahimovic-little-brother-shining/blte66fa6811776f2ba" title="Is Rafael Leao really the new Henry?

<p>It would have been a perfect position for a right-footed in-swinger, but the precocious Issahaku had other ideas.</p>
<p>After a deep breath, he began his run-up and duly slammed home a remarkable effort with the outside of his left foot.</p>
<p>The Uzbek keeper ought to have done better, but a combination of Issahakuâs audacity and the thunderous power of the shot proved too much for the hapless shot-stopper.</p>
<p>This, if you believe the local buzz, is a sign of things to come from the prodigy, who also clinched the Player of the Tournament award as a 16-year-old as&nbsp;Ghana claimed the Under-20 Africa Cup of Nations in Mauritania earlier this year, announcing himself to a continental audience.</p>
<p>Previous winners of the award include Benni McCarthy and new Leicester City signing&nbsp;Patson Daka, so while Issahaku must avoid the many pitfalls and obstacles that can befall the gameâs brightest wonderkids, it is&nbsp;certainly an encouraging start to his career.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">A bright side to the Black Stars B Uzbekistan loss.

<p>As highlighted&nbsp;in the Uzbekistan game, he also excels with shots&nbsp;from range, and having scored sensational efforts from just inside the opposition half during his club career; he repeated the feat at the U20 Afcon by netting from near the halfway line against Tanzania.</p>
<p>These were not simply strikes from range, they were audacious attempts by a player who is harnessing his explosive abilities&nbsp;at a startlingly young age.</p>
<p>âHis performances are magical,â Mohammed Gargo, head coach of Issahakuâs current club Steadfast FC, tells <strong>Goal</strong>. âItâs been a long while since I have seen&nbsp;a youngster with this talent.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">ðï¸ Vision<br>ð Power<br>ð Execution<br><br>ð¬ð­ Issahaku's magnificent strike had it all! ð<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TotalAFCONU20?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TotalAFCONU20</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoalOfTheDay?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GoalOfTheDay</a> <a href="https://t.co/VNj4nT3kVd">pic.twitter.com/VNj4nT3kVd</a></p>â CAF (@CAF_Online) <a href="https://twitter.com/CAF_Online/status/1361806905002319874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2021</a></blockquote><p>âI believe he is gifted, and heâs been fantastic throughout all the matches heâs played with us and the national teams.</p>
<p>âThe goal [against Uzbekistan] was exceptional, and we were expecting that someone like him should do even better.â</p>
<p>Issahaku has been with Steadfast since 2019, when he was spotted by the club playing in an U13s tournament while at the Tamale Utrecht academy in the Northern Region.</p>
<p>Even then, the fleet-footed forward was head and shoulders above his peers, top scoring in the competition with 13 goals.</p>

He has played as a No.10 and as a No.8, but his best performances have come on the right flank, where he can take on and beat his man, then cut inside and rifle towards goal with his left foot.</p>
<p>While forward-looking and ambitious in possession, he does not shirk his defensive duties, although with the outrageous goals from distance also comes significant profligacy â he failed to hit the target with over 50 per cent of his attempts on goal at the U20 Afcon, and it is&nbsp;an element of his game that will need to be refined in the professional game.</p>
<p>âHeâs still a young lad and he needs to be a little bit simple at times,â Gargo notes. âFrom my technical point of view, he over-elaborates things sometimes, but now that heâs growing, things will change.</p>
<p>âWeâre still&nbsp;trying to make him understand that sometimes you need to respect your opponents as well. So in order to avoid causing yourself a lot of injuries, you need to release the ball when you need to.</p>
<p>âWith that, heâll become a great star.â</p>
<p></p>

<p>Following his arrival at&nbsp;Steadfast, Issahaku wasted little time in hitting his stride, and was the top scorer in Zone One of the Ghanaian Division One in 2020 before Covid-19 brought the season to a premature close.</p>
<p>The suspension of action did not slow his progress, though, with the youngster having a hand in 17 goals - six assists and&nbsp;11 goals - in his first 11 games of the current campaign.</p>
<p>The confidence, then, that permitted that audacious free-kick against Uzbekistan has also been evident in his domestic performances.</p>
<p>âEven though he is one of the youngest players we have in the team, all the senior players respect him on the field and they look for him,â Steadfast media manager, Musah Abdul-Rahim,&nbsp;told <em>First Time Finish</em>. âBecause of his input in games, he has been able to command respect from the senior players.â</p>
<p>Since the U20 Nations Cup, Issahakuâs name has made increasing appearances in transfer rumour mills and gossip columns, with Liverpool regularly being tipped as the youngsterâs next destination.</p>

<p>Reports now suggest that Portuguese champions Sporting C.P. are set to win the race to sign Issahaku, as he prepares to embark on a European adventure.</p>
<p>âI expect him to really excel,â Gargo concludes. âIf you look at him and what he does, the sky is the limit.</p>
<p>âHeâs been always outstanding, always ready and he gives more than 100 per cent of himself in all that he does on the pitch.</p>
