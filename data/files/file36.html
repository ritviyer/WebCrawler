They took the lead in the eighth minute when McTominay nodded in, but after that, the best chances fell to Villa, with Watkins smashing an effort off the bar in the first half. In the second, they hit the back of the net twice, with both being ruled out. Ings headed in from very close range, but VAR ruled it out for a foul on Cavani and the second was tapped in by Watkins, only for a belated flag to go up against Ings in the build-up.Â  </span> </div> </div>  <div class="comment">  <div class="comment-desc">  <span class="time">90&#039; + 7&#039;</span>   <span class="text"> FULL-TIME: MANCHESTER UNITED 1-0 ASTON VILLA. </span> </div> </div>  <div class="comment">  <div class="comment-desc">  <span class="time">90&#039; + 5&#039;</span>   <span class="text"> Elanga plays a one-two with McTominay and makes another good run down the left.

United lost their first match under interim boss Ralf Rangnick last time out against Wolves which ended a five-game unbeaten run in all competitions under him (W3 D2).
