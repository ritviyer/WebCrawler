<p>The Brazilian right-back, now 30 and with Besiktas, is best known for his bizarre stint with the Blaugrana, for whom he signed from Sao Paolo in 2014.</p>
<p>Douglas was a Barca player until 2019, but during that time he only made three Liga appearances&nbsp;and spent the final three years of his five-year contract out on loan.</p><div class="widget-inline-editors-picks clearfix"> <h3>Editors&#039; Picks</h3> <ul>  <li> <a href="/en-za/news/mamelodi-sundowns-sirino-would-price-tag-be-a-stumbling/blt7739497b242d34dc" title="Mamelodi Sundowns&#039; Sirino: Would price-tag be a stumbling block for Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates?"> Mamelodi Sundowns&#039; Sirino: Would price-tag be a stumbling block for Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates? </a> </li>  <li> <a href="/en-za/news/psg-transfer-target-faivre/blt4c3a2236074a03f5" title="Romain emperor: PSG transfer target Faivre ready for the big time"> Romain emperor: PSG transfer target Faivre ready for the big time </a> </li>  <li> <a href="/en-za/news/has-khune-given-kaizer-chiefs-coach-baxter-something-to/blt44d7077b8fd4ce3c" title="Has Khune given Kaizer Chiefs coach Baxter something to think about?"> Has Khune given Kaizer Chiefs coach Baxter something to think about? </a> </li>  <li> <a href="/en-za/news/from-title-glory-to-bitter-divorce-conte-chelsea-tenure/bltf29875efd62af620" title="From title glory to a Â£26m divorce: Inside Conte&#039;s tumultuous Chelsea tenure"> From title glory to a Â£26m divorce: Inside Conte&#039;s tumultuous Chelsea tenure </a> </li>  </ul> </div>
<p>How his move to Barca came about in the first place remains a mystery to supporters. He had hardly ripped it up in Serie A, and, while he had been part of the Brazil side that reached the final of the 2009 Under-20 World Cup, he was 24 by the time he moved to Camp Nou â in professional football terms, hardly a young prospect.</p>
<p>A clue may come in his fee;&nbsp;Douglas joined Barca for â¬4 million (Â£3.5m/$5m) plus â¬1.5m (Â£1.3m/$2m) in add-ons. He was a bargain buy to pad out Luis Enriqueâs squad.</p>
<p>Douglasâ La Liga debut for Barcelona came against Malaga, and, in a positive sense,&nbsp;he kept a clean sheet in a 0-0 draw. On the other, his personal performance was less than impressive. Reports at the time were unkind,&nbsp;noting Douglas was visibly lacking confidence and had notably negative body language.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The low point came when he picked up a booking for a needless tackle on Malaga midfielder Duda, a 34-year-old with no turn of speed who had his back to goal.</p>
<p>Douglas came charging in with a tackle that was weak and off balance, giving away a free-kick and earning a pointless booking. It was the beginning of the end.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/blt427fde6df52a88b4/60dacd955775160f9f1eea2b/7bbabeb56bab9c7174969f403b203a6151cacc75.jpeg?quality=60&width=190" alt="" /></div><p></p>
<p>Other aspects of his debut were equally poor. Full-backs at Barca are supposed to act as a supplementary attacking outlet, especially against notably weaker opponents such as Malaga. Yet in that game, Douglas passed the ball backwards 31 times.</p>
<p>He was clearly not up to the required level&nbsp;and became Barcaâs third-choice right-back, behind Dani Alves and Martin Montoya, and was restricted to making occasional Copa del Rey appearances&nbsp;and the odd cameo in other competitions.</p>
<p>In total across his first two seasons at Barca, before his loan adventures commenced, Douglas played in eight games for the club â almost as many trophies as they earned during that period.</p>
<p>Barca won the treble in 2014-15, began the subsequent campaign with the UEFA Super Cup, and in 2015-16 went on to claim the domestic double and the FIFA Club World Cup.</p>
<p>While the silverware rained down&nbsp;for Barca, however, Douglas'&nbsp;dream move turned nightmarish. Way out of his depth and suffering constant niggling injuries â he had four separate spells on the treatment table in his first season there â <a href="https://en.as.com/en/2016/10/20/football/1476962447_152138.html" target="_blank"> he admitted to <em> AS </em> in a 2016 interview</a> that he was frequently brought to tears.</p>
<p>He said: âIn Barcelona I had some tough times with injuries. I'd come home crying every day.â</p>
<p></p>
<div class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/bltcfa6a9de9013705f/60dacdad3388dd0edc06af47/4ba1bbf4f9c7a450a62522d8869f50494ee9f226.jpeg?quality=60&width=190" alt="" /></div><p></p>
<p>From year three onwards, Douglas was consigned to an eternal loan spiral away from Barcelona, although reports suggest he did not go without a fight. He was, after all, a squad player in one of the greatest club sides ever, with team-mates including Lionel Messi, Xavi, Neymar and Andres Iniesta.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sport.es/en/news/barca/douglas-squatted-at-camp-nou-5396769#ifrndnloc" target="_blank"><em>Sport</em></a><em> </em><a href="https://www.sport.es/en/news/barca/douglas-squatted-at-camp-nou-5396769#ifrndnloc" target="_blank"> </a> reported that he initially refused to sign the papers confirming his loan to Sporting Gijon, and instead staged a sit-down protest in the clubâs offices, refusing to leave, before eventually being coaxed into confirming the transfer.</p>
<p>At Sporting he played regularly during their 2016-17 relegation campaign but there were reports he suffered a strange&nbsp;injury -&nbsp;straining a muscle in his backside after falling asleep in an awkward position on the team coach.</p>
<p>Douglas denied these claims in his <em> AS </em> interview: âThat wasn't right at all. It was just an overstretched muscle and [all it needed was] a massage. I was training the next day&nbsp;and it was written that I was injured when I wasn't. That saddens me.â</p>
<p>Following his Sporting stint, he had 12 months as a reserve at Benfica, before being key for Sivasspor in his one year there. Eventually, Douglas left Camp Nou permanently for Besiktas in the summer of 2019.</p>
<p>After starting off in the first team picture with the Super Lig giants, injuries struck again. Torn ankle ligaments and a thigh muscle rupture restricted him to just 58 minutes of first team action after October 2019.</p>
<p>For 2020-21 he is not even registered in the Besiktas squad, <a href="https://www.fanatik.com.tr/besiktasin-kayip-adami-douglas-santos-2202427" target="_blank"> with reports in Turkey</a> indicating that he will be released when his contract expires this summer.</p>
