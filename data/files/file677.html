<p>One major difference was the central midfield options Gareth Southgate had&nbsp;at his&nbsp;disposal.</p>
<p>In 2021, the Three Lions&nbsp;had Declan Rice and Mason Mount to dictate the tempo, alongside Kalvin Phillips, one of the true breakout stars of the competition.</p><div class="widget-inline-editors-picks clearfix"> <h3>Editors&#039; Picks</h3> <ul>  <li> <a href="/en-za/news/mamelodi-sundowns-sirino-would-price-tag-be-a-stumbling/blt7739497b242d34dc" title="Mamelodi Sundowns&#039; Sirino: Would price-tag be a stumbling block for Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates?"> Mamelodi Sundowns&#039; Sirino: Would price-tag be a stumbling block for Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates? </a> </li>  <li> <a href="/en-za/news/psg-transfer-target-faivre/blt4c3a2236074a03f5" title="Romain emperor: PSG transfer target Faivre ready for the big time"> Romain emperor: PSG transfer target Faivre ready for the big time </a> </li>  <li> <a href="/en-za/news/has-khune-given-kaizer-chiefs-coach-baxter-something-to/blt44d7077b8fd4ce3c" title="Has Khune given Kaizer Chiefs coach Baxter something to think about?"> Has Khune given Kaizer Chiefs coach Baxter something to think about? </a> </li>  <li> <a href="/en-za/news/from-title-glory-to-bitter-divorce-conte-chelsea-tenure/bltf29875efd62af620" title="From title glory to a Â£26m divorce: Inside Conte&#039;s tumultuous Chelsea tenure"> From title glory to a Â£26m divorce: Inside Conte&#039;s tumultuous Chelsea tenure </a> </li>  </ul> </div>
<p>In 2016, however, Roy Hodgson had cobbled together an unappetising mix of an over-the-hill Steven Gerrard, an out-of-position Wayne Rooney, and numerous players well short of peak ability or tournament fitness in Jordan Henderson, Dele Alli and&nbsp;Eric Dier.</p>
<p>In addition, Hodgson had a choice between Danny Drinkwater and Jack Wilshere.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;one hand, Drinkwater had just lifted the Premier League title with Leicester City, forming a sensational midfield partnership&nbsp;alongside N'Golo Kante, providing creativity and passing range alongside the diminutive French battleship.</p>
<p>On the other, Wilshere had played a total of 141 minutes of senior football in the whole of the 2015-16 season, sidelined for much of the campaign with Arsenal due to a fractured calf bone.</p>
<p>It was, however, Wilshere who was rushed into action, and who looked horrendously rusty during an hour of the dire goalless group-stage&nbsp;draw with Slovakia, followed by 45 minutes as a second-half substitute against Iceland, in which he failed to spark England into life as they were humiliated and dumped out of the competition.</p>
<p>Hodgson was pilloried for his blind faith in Wilshere, who until that point had been regarded as the future of England's midfield - capable of moments of creative genius both for Arsenal and his country, shown in flashes between his serious injury absences.</p>
<p>Euro 2016 was the moment that patience wore off for fans, managers and pundits alike&nbsp;when it came to Wilshere - the last of his 34 England caps was that nightmare in Nice.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/bltf6616247a113e318/6114de4f33f55a6b9678ab70/165cb02275efcc6c6c69a983b0e2d1cf706c7e27.png?quality=60&width=190" alt="" /></div><p></p>
<p>So we fast-forward to 2021, where England have just played in their first major tournament final for 55 years; while Wilshere has just been released from second-tier Bournemouth, and at 29 is at arguably the biggest crossroads of his career yet.</p>
<p>Wilshere, given the choice, would turn around and proceed all the way back up the road he came, back to Arsenal.</p>
<p>His social media is full of comments on the Gunners' recent fortunes - <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-za/news/wilshere-perplexed-arsenal-confirm-bould-exit/1uanbbv9dotw91rqthrkbd2deh" target="_blank"> including a furious reaction </a> to recent news of long-serving coach Steve Bould's exit - and&nbsp; he serves as a regular on Arsenal-focused podcasts and YouTube panels .</p>
<p>He admitted in an interview with <em> The Guardian </em> earlier this year that he regrets leaving the Emirates Stadium, despite becoming less of a first-team presence towards the end of his time there.</p>
<p>He said in March: "Itâs gone now, that feeling that I could still be there.</p>
<p>"I decided to leave, whether it was right or wrong. At the time it felt right, and probably in hindsight it wasnât right, but it is what it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I remember when I was a player -&nbsp;and Iâve got a lot of Arsenal friends and family around me -&nbsp;and I always remember them saying: âItâs difficult to be an Arsenal fan.â Now I know what they mean! Now it is strange but I still feel like it is part of me."</p>
<p>Sadly for Wilshere, that is not an option. He is a free agent, released from Bournemouth after the six-month deal he signed in January expired, as new manager Scott Parker decided&nbsp;to go in a different direction.</p>
<p>Wilshere, despite not quite managing to inspire the Cherries to a play-off place, leaves the Vitality Stadium with the respect of Bournemouth intact. &nbsp;He made 17 appearances, and in January managed to score his first senior goal since August 2019.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/bltbe88d3fb55f36165/6114de51cd51ea66257ad785/353576c65abe3ffd658ff7ae7237c2b0293321bd.png?quality=60&width=190" alt="" /></div><p></p>
<p>The question now stands of where Wilshere will go next, having admitted when he first joined Bournemouth that he had never seen himself playing outside the top tier.</p>
<p>âI haven't played in the Championship or tried to win promotion before. If you had asked me 10 years ago if this was something I thought I'd ever be involved in, I would have said no,â Wilshere said in January.</p>
<p>He has proven&nbsp;he can still cut it at Championship level when fit, while there may also be options of a move to sunnier climes,&nbsp;with Wilshere having&nbsp;recently asking Kieran Gibbs, seemingly tongue in cheek, whether they need a new midfielder at Inter Miami.</p>
<p>The question, though, is whether Wilshere wants to keep playing, though his answer when joining Bournemouth following three months as a free agent&nbsp;after being released by West Ham, suggests retirement is not an option quite yet.</p>
<p>âI've been lucky enough to earn good money throughout my career, but being out of the game for three months made me realise I want to play this game for as long as possible", he said earlier this year.</p>
<p>Yet with an unreliable body - continuous issues with his ankle and groin, plus that cracked calf bone, have caused him to miss an estimated 214 club games throughout his career -&nbsp;sheer enthusiasm can only last so long.</p>
<p>It is probable that we will see Wilshere back on the field of play at some point in 2021-22, his reputation still strong enough for a club somewhere to take a chance on him.</p>
<p>It will not, though, be at the level which would have been thought of five years ago for a player who the England manager was willing to stake it all on to run his midfield at a major tournament.</p>
